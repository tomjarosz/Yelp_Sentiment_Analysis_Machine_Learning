27964,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.7,there's good and not so good things about the zoo,
27965,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.7,let's start with the good:,
27966,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.358333333,i thought the giraffes and zebra's were beautiful! i really like the giraffe enclosure it's a nice size and it has different animals roaming around with them like two huge cows with long horns attached and some ostrich and some thing else i don't remember what though,
27967,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.516666667,i also liked the bear enclosure it was really cool and nice,
27968,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.3,it was fun to see the wolves running around in a pack like formation as if they were hunting,
27969,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.425,the cheetah brother triplets were cool as well and the otters are cute,
27970,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.328125,also a big bonus is that they have a little mini petting farm for kids to interact with farm animals i thought that was awesome not just for the kids but for me as well i love farm animals,
27971,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.35,anyone who wants to get close to farm animals will love having a chance to pet them,

27973,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.001757813,and then there's another one where you can see these big fat furball prairie dogs up-close as well as some vulture looking birds above them (vegetarian i'm guessing otherwise they would swoop the cute little prarie dogs away in which case i would find a way to sue them for all they have!!!) and some other birds as well,
27974,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,"andd you can feed a giraffe, touch some stingrays, and ride a camel but you have to pay like five bucks for each",
27975,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,i think three for the stingrays,
27976,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.35,but still a really cool experience,
27977,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,as for the things i didn't like:,
27978,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,it's safari themed,
27979,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.125,i'm really into green landscape lots of grass and trees and stuff like that but since this is a desert and most of the animals are from africa it has that african safari sort of feel,
27980,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.8,it's great if you like that atmosphere,
27981,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,i also didn't like the size of the enclosures,
27982,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,-0.127272727,they were pretty small and i just couldn't help but think about how i would hate to live closed up in a tiny space like that,
27983,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,-0.016666667,they absolutely need to make them all bigger!! also the quantity of animals is small,
27984,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,-0.14,"don't get me wrong there's a lot of different animals there's zebras, lions, cheetahs, tigers, snakes, kamoto dragon, bear, flamingos, etc etc, but most of them are trapped in the enclosure by themselves which is sad if you think about that stuff",
27985,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,-0.191260823,it's bad enough they live trapped in a limited space but some of them are there by themselves i mean come on,
27986,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.2,but i do want to note that this is a place that takes in animals that were taken from the wild as pets and the owners surrendered them so they can't just go back to the wild so i can't be too harsh the zoo is trying their best,
27987,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.183333333,also another thing i didn't like which doesn't have anything to do with the animal aspect is the price! the food and entrance are pricy but the thing that saves it are the memberships! you can buy yearly memberships and i think it's decent priced if you plan on going the whole year,
27988,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.188095238,they have single memberships or family ones and the one i have is i can bring in two different adults and 10 kids aged 3-18 and i love it because i get to bring in different friends and family members any time i want throughout the year so it works great for me,
27989,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,also you can bring in food,
27990,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,just don't feed the animals,
27991,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,1,and on another note somebody brought up a good point about zoo lights let the animals rest will ya!!!!!!!!!,
27992,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0.3,all and all i like the zoo i go regularly and it's a nice family outing,
27993,pDVW6IAdBQJYWtHkNPvLMA,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,ICIcm4EntrOqH_r19i-oCQ,4,0,i recommend it,

27995,Ij1PpIQIL4kj33p91WC-zg,1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA,zhVOlwBuEgdGlHjwgVf3Jg,4,0.5,the tiger and lion exhibits could be a lot better,
