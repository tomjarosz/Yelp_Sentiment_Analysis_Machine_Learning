269012,Pec_CKbPOo7g4QB61GcEzg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,LISp8sR4mS5DLxQ6HRTUQA,5,0,you aren't charged to hold the reservation - just when you check in to to jump
269013,Pec_CKbPOo7g4QB61GcEzg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,LISp8sR4mS5DLxQ6HRTUQA,5,0,i waited around for a bit for some friends to arrive and chatted with alexa (sp?)

269021,Pec_CKbPOo7g4QB61GcEzg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,LISp8sR4mS5DLxQ6HRTUQA,5,0,avoid the heat and do it at night

269028,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,i am a thrill seeker
269029,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.5,i love roller coasters
269030,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.2,i have bungee jumped and i did terminal velocity at wisconsin dells which is a 100-foot free fall into a net
269031,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,"that being said, i was scared about doing this"
269032,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,just the sheer height - 108 stories is daunting
269033,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,one of my traveling companions suggested doing it a couple months ago
269034,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,my initial reaction was no way
269035,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.5,then i saw the youtube videos and thought ok
269036,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,then the day came and got there and initially decided not to
269037,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,-0.1,buddy did it and heard him and others talk about it being fun and not all that scary once you let yourself off the platform
269038,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.4,"agreed, gotta psyche yourself up to jump but once you jump, you will enjoy it"

269040,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.25,scariest parts are standing on the platform waiting and at the end when you feel like you are coming in hot
269041,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0.5,"although it is a controlled fall, it was still an enjoyable rush"
269042,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,0,"if you are thinking about doing it but have reservations, go ahead and do it"
269043,ywocmFR6wjMP8xJyKj6SpQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,uRhxqIdyu_jjoDKm8lSEDg,5,-0.1,you will not have any regrets

269045,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.321428571,the first thing i can say for skyjump is it certainly felt safe
269046,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.05,my harness was adjusted by attentive employees at least three times

269048,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0,"so if you're worried about actually falling to your death, allow me to comfort you on this aspect"
269049,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.214285714,the view and the jump experience certainly is motivating

269051,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.075,"even once the ropes start to slow you it's still pretty damn exciting: however, the least exciting part of it is how much the harness pulls you by the groin"
269052,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.044444444,"not pleasant, and could have been avoided with a different harness, but it's not awful"

269054,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0.05,"you will also have something to talk about if you ever run into ronnie from the jersey shore, because apparently he did this too (they have pictures) but when is that going to happen"
269055,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,0,and why would you want to do that anyways
269056,qHTVHjDnvFZgWrwWGF4clw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,V-4RQc4L9Q5aaD-NVJIIgA,4,-0.6,majorly awkward

269058,GDeFAltD5aovf7YquuSJtw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Bg-LAx67quoNgLvcqLrEmA,5,0,my husband and my 2 girls did this and it was the highlight of our las vegas trip
269059,GDeFAltD5aovf7YquuSJtw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Bg-LAx67quoNgLvcqLrEmA,5,0,it was $109

269062,GDeFAltD5aovf7YquuSJtw,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Bg-LAx67quoNgLvcqLrEmA,5,0,they give you a jump drive to take home that has the video and pictures

269069,BkANHCMhk8aMGcxQray0Ng,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Ok2WfTykukqTVoULYaDj9g,5,0.125,"definitely the most extreme thrill ride in vegas, and for that the skyjump gets a 5 star review"

269072,BkANHCMhk8aMGcxQray0Ng,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Ok2WfTykukqTVoULYaDj9g,5,-0.05,we did get to see the ride in action and watched a few jumps and had 2-for-1 martinis in the skybar while contemplating dinner in the revolving restaurant
269073,BkANHCMhk8aMGcxQray0Ng,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Ok2WfTykukqTVoULYaDj9g,5,0,maybe on a next trip to vegas (?)
269074,BkANHCMhk8aMGcxQray0Ng,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Ok2WfTykukqTVoULYaDj9g,5,0.15,also my buddy was so wasted he almost bought one of those tacky light up t shirts in the lobby! and there was no bubble tea

269076,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,i recently did the skyjump when i had some friends visiting town
269077,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,-0.155555556,"i had wanted to try it, but just never made it down there until now"
269078,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.075,"we were really excited to jump, but i was kind of disappointed after the jump was done"
269079,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,here's why:
269080,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,-0.5,it is extremely expensive
269081,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,regular price is $125
269082,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.275,for a few dollars more you can skydive in jean or boulder city and have more fun
269083,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,"they do have a local rate of $99, but you have to ask for it before you pay"
269084,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.4,the good part of the locals rate was that my out of town friends were able to get the local rate with my id since we all jumped together
269085,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.081481481,"if you have ever skydived or bungeed, which i have on several occasions, this will be a huge let down"

269087,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.45,"if you have never jumped out of a plane or bungeed, you would probably enjoy it more"

269089,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,i wish we would have done it at night when the lights were on
269090,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,-1,day time jumps are boring
269091,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0.16,"so if you have never jumped from a high spot before, go try it out"
269092,6eJCHmLllGbH0wcEN4fKHg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,Cw3UMmYeqqx1u4HIWaWw3w,2,0,"if you have jumped before, be warned"

269094,VQswttj9IktSyiuEb2NDWg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,MrmNkLKORAE1PkjCsrXptw,5,0,"it's no skydiving, but definitely a different experience when u jump off the edge"

269101,BVlUuif6FVneo7QI3Jq9gg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,53nLX7Y4cTt87UPckhBoPQ,4,0.1,"the only reason that i gave it four stars is the cost and the fact that they don't really tell you how to land, until you're landing"
269102,BVlUuif6FVneo7QI3Jq9gg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,53nLX7Y4cTt87UPckhBoPQ,4,0.5,the staff is great and really help put your mind at ease if you're nervous
269103,BVlUuif6FVneo7QI3Jq9gg,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,53nLX7Y4cTt87UPckhBoPQ,4,0,everyone you pass does a safety check on your harness

269436,BxWxKUwJTxrpWCDo_WwpSQ,utSuiRS-hZnmHoPHdjw6dA,94HDTyTg-fehT7AJqGwVfw,1,0,we figured it was because we came the last hour and the employees wanted to play around instead of doing what they are paid to do
