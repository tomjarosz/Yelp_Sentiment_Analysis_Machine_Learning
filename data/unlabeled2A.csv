282448,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.2,they have 6 replica stadiums where you feel like you're playing in the real deal
282449,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,they have two sports clubs where you can get food and drink and batting cages
282450,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,i played there for over a year before i gave up on the place and this is why
282451,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,1 - the fields are much smaller than city/county fields
282452,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.0625,city/county are 300ft deep all around and the bases are 70ft apart from each other
282453,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,bld has fields as short as 265ft deep
282454,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,in fact there are only two spots that reach 300ft amongst all 6 fields
282455,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.141666667,"you feel great when you hit a homer, but then everyone hits weak homers and scores regularly get over 25 runs for each team"
282456,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.185,"their bases are 60ft from ea other, so turning double plays is rare and people are almost always safe at first"
282457,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.1,this gets old after a while
282458,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,2 - they haven't improved the fields since they've opened
282459,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.064583333,"all the outfield graphics are drastically faded, the batting cage nets are filled with holes and the outfield has giant worn out spots that get hard as concrete"

282461,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.4,this makes the balls fly significantly further
282462,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.5,"many of the roided out clowns hit balls over their nets, which measures over 400ft"
282463,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.3,4-  my biggest complaint has to be the quality of their umpires
282464,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.45,"this place is like a stepping stone for players that want to become umps, that have no experience and get it by becoming umps there"

282466,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.4,so you often get games poorly called and biased
282467,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.5,5- the egos and tempers of many players/teams is off the charts
282468,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.8,"the crap that isn't tolerated at city/county fields, is enabled at bld"
282469,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,fights happen often and arguing isn't diffused by these rookie umps
282470,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0.4,6- you pay a huge premium (compared to city/county) to play here
282471,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.2,"in the beginning it wasn't so bad, but as the venue deteriorated and the quality of teams did as well, paying a premium was no longer worth it"
282472,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,7- they charge $3 a person to come in
282473,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,family has to pay to come watch you play
282474,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,0,they don't offer any type of season pass to give regulars a discount

282477,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.1875,bld is little league softball for grown ups
282478,YyvD-QI_u4pjJbvzSPgMtA,pgdcEUFhg2qqkVwhSxG6Zg,8eENDowTpMmU2Qw1LQUriw,1,-0.05,they fields are really small and there are too many immature adults that ruin the game
