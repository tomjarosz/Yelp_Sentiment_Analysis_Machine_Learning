When Amtrak is on time, or if it\'s less than say an hour late, it can be wonderful.  The problem is that Amtrak is at the mercy of the freight railroads that own the tracks. \n\nLast year, according to my husband the train enthusiast, the train was constantly arriving into Chicago 4 to 5 hours late because of extreme frieght train congestion.

It\'s also nice that your food travels with you and you can get up and stretch your legs when you want to.\n\nAmtrak used to run two trains a day to Chicago and two across Pennsylvania.  Unfortunately, budget cuts a few years ago caused one of these to be cancelled, so it is much less convenient.  Also, the train to Washington, DC leaves Pittsburgh in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nOne thing I like is that Amtrak, upon 24 hours notice, will provide refridgeration or ice for my insulin.  If you are a "special needs" traveller, they can usually accomodate you with advanced notice.  One other tip.  If you are using Amtrak, you can actually check your trains\' on-time record using the website.  You can see which trains have good on-time records and which don\'t (and believe my husband when he says it varies from route to route).

If you look them up in the KOA directory you'll see that they boast about on site camp store, Blimpie, gas ,etc.  This is  because the campground is located AT THE GAS STATION.  The camp store isn't a camp store...it's a gas station convenience store with a Blimpie in it.  And worse than that, connected to the convenience store is a neighborhood dive bar.\nThe pull through sites are very long but most have just rocks and no smooth spot at all.\nThey don't have any fire rings yet sell firewood at the store.  We asked about making a fire and the gas attendant, uh Blimpie worker, uh convenience store worker, uh campground worker told us to just make it on the ground...IN THE GRASS! (The rocky pull through site was so bad that we asked to be moved to a grassy back in one)\nHere's the worst part...the dive bar gets crowds at night and they allow them to park up into the campground.  Supposedly they have security in the front but we drove right past them coming back one night.  One afternoon, I went into my cooler to find out that beer and wine were stolen from it...no doubt from the drunks leaving the bar.  This was a first for me.  It forced us to clean up everything we had outside, put it away and lock all of our storage compartments. \nThis campground appears to be a 1 night stay over place on your way to somewhere else.  I suppose it's ok for that, just don't leave anything outside and make sure you get a site WAY in the back so you don't hear the motorcycles and cars starting at 2am when everyone leaves the bar.  It is NOT a family campground and I wish I knew that ahead of time.\nNever again!", 'stars': 1, 'user_id': '0ytVGmvyKzWb1ur6AiAflg'}

Parking is a mess, and I fortunately have a Meriter parking pass, so we walked there from the garage. Construction must be making things difficult, because on that fairly straightforward walk, we kept being kicked to the other side of the street by construction signs. This wouldn't be so big a deal, but 3-year-olds have a tendency to slowly drift across the street, rather than walk with a purpose. We were asked to sign in by an unattended book as we entered. I was fairly sure that the 9-year-old (boy) had already taken a class trip to see it, as he seemed nonplussed but well-aware of the various sections. He did take his totally-cowed little sister through the world's tiniest cave simulation, approximately six feet long. We also went into the mineral room with a black light, to show minerals that glow under that condition. While we only saw a few that actually lit up, but were also unclear on the instructions (make sure you read those thoroughly before turning the light off - it doesn't come back on for a while). They were both impressed by that, but wondered why so many didn't work (search me, kids, I went to law school). They weren't terribly intrigued by the shoehorning in of Wisconsin history as relates to the mining trade, but I appreciated it. Much of it was too over the head of the three-year-old, so a good game to play with toddlers is to have them pick out their favorite mineral in each case and attempt to pronounce it for them.\n\nThe kids breezed through the initial fossil section, paying little attention. It can be a bit dry when one is not on an organized trip with a guide to point out the interesting parts which keep them entertained. There was such a group in the next room, which really is the crowning jewel of the tiny museum. This is the room with dinosaur bones and bone molds, showing off several prehistoric skeletons from dinosaurs, woolly mammoths, etc.The guide was helpful and informative that day, and held the rapt attention of kids between the ages of 10 and 14, not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It's a small museum, but it did have things that appeal to children of widely divergent ages and interests, and there are few museums who succeed at doing that. There's also a neat rock garden outside with a fountain. There is one central map of the garden, with descriptions of the type of rock that resides at each numbered space. The older boy loved scrambling around to find all the rocks, while the little girl enjoyed the fountain - but use caution around it, because those wet rocks are VERY slippery. I'm not sure how much there is left to return to this summer with the kids, but it's an excellent 1.5 hour diversion, and it's free.", 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'AEIKxjduqqu545E3T2lHog'}

Not only is it too hot for you, it might also be too hot for the animals and they\'ll be camped out in the back under some shade.  \n - The monkeys are awesome, as always, but they have a great area.\n - They have a really diverse group of animals in a diverse setting - from visiting the croc swamp to barren desert prairies.\n - The food isn\'t half bad!  We were surprised!\n - Zoo Lights!  Starting around Thanksgiving and going through January they light up much of the zoo with cool themed displays.  It\'s not the entire zoo, so less of a walk, but enough of one that it\'s worth the price of admission.\n - It\'s conveniently close to the Desert Botanical Gardens if you want to make your trip a 2-fer.\n - 2 Words - PETTING ZOO!

It was amazing.  \n\nThough it\'s gone through an expansion since then, it\'s surprising how small this library seems now in comparison to the mega-mart libraries that have sprouted up in other parts of town.  It\'s gone from being THE library in the area, to one of the smaller libraries in the general area.  It\'s still a great neighborhood library though.

Arizona Shuttle is one of the only and most economic options in Arizona for getting from city a to city b if you don't have or don't want to use your car and it does so for a relatively cheap price of $27-$37. Is it the most comfortable and best smelling trip? Nope. \n\nWhile taking a trip to Tucson for Yelp Tucson's very first elite party, I had a ride back but not a ride there so either we would have two cars going back or I could do something like the shuttle. And since I hate driving on the 10 late at night, I opted for the latter. Enter Arizona Shuttle. It just took a couple clicks on the internet to make my reservation and after confirmation, they told me to meet at Sky Harbor Airport at 11:15 and the shuttle would leave at exactly at 11:30. Well, I arrived at 11:15 but did the shuttle leave at 11:30? Nope...more like 11:50. So I rushed to check in at the time they told me, but then I waited around for 40+ minutes before the shuttle left. They offered several different shuttle times too and I chose the 11:30 one because it would get me to Tucson when I need to be there, but since the shuttle was 20 minutes late, it then made me 20 minutes late in arriving to Tucson. When relying on a shuttle service like this, I was hoping they would be on time since I planned my schedule around the shuttle leaving on time. I understand it may take longer to get there with traffic etc, but the shuttle company could have delivered when it came to leaving on time. \n\nThe shuttle ride itself was pretty much what I expected. It's a van full of folks needing a ride. It was a little cramped, a little smelly, the windows didn't open and the drive is long. Weirdly enough, a trailer was hitched to the back and I worried it would detach on the road, but it seemed to work and held our luggage. In addition, as I was exiting the shuttle when I got to Tucson, the girl behind me also exited...with her ferret. Apparently I had been riding the whole way with a ferret behind me. It might have been nice for them to warn the passengers. However, the upside to taking a shuttle to Tucson was that instead of doing the drive myself, I was able to get a lot of work done on my computer (thank you Verizon network card!), so it wasn't a total loss of 2 hours. \n\nSo in summary, taking the Arizona Shuttle would have provided me with the experience I expected, if we didn't get off on the wrong foot when the shuttle was 20 minutes tardy. But, if faced with the situation, I would probably use Arizona Shuttle again and it's a decent option if you need to get to any of the Arizona cities and you'd rather not rent a car and pay much more.", 'stars': 3, 'user_id': '4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ'}

Never.\n\nI had the unfortunate experience of riding Greyhound just after graduating college.  My experience was that the facilities and buses were dirty. The facility lacked adequate security.  Now I find out that they are targeting the very people that keep them in business by charging those who most need their service HUGE service fees.\n\nMy latest experience:  It was horrible.\n\nMy sister, who is staying with me while she completes testing and assessments in consideration for a liver transplant, needed to return to Yuma immediately to provide care for another family member.\n\nBecause my sister does not have checking or lines of credit, she asked me if I could book her ride for her online.  She wanted to make sure that she had a spot reserved.  I went to Greyhound.com to arrange for a ticket and transportation for my sister.  Greyhound quoted a price of $34.32 for a one way ticket. As I completed the forms online and proceeded to checkout, the cost of the ticket had changed to $52.32.  As I researched the change further, I realized that Greyhound has a policy of charging an $18.00 fee if you buy the ticket but are not the person using the ticket.  Greyhound listed the fee as a "Gift Ticket Fee."\n\nI contacted Greyhound customer service. Based upon my conversation and the lack of English spoken by the rep, I am assuming that Greyhound has outsourced its call center function overseas.  The CSR I spoke with explained to me that the fee is a policy of Greyhound and it is charged to cover the additional costs and for convenience.  I asked him to breakdown what additional costs they were incurring?  He was unable or unwilling to justify the fee.  He kept reiterating that "this is our policy and you must pay Gift Ticket Fee."\n\nMy feeling here is the Greyhound has instituted a policy that is direct fee on the poor and indigent.  This policy has the DIRECT EFFECT of raising rates on those who can least afford it.  In my sisters case, the cost for me to book her bus fare was an INCREDIBLE 52% INCREASE over the advertised fare.\n\nGreyhound...it is no wonder your ridership is in continual decline.

I made sure to bring my gel saddle, sure that my comfy girlie saddle from home would not come standard. A good bike overall, for mid range. \n\nThe staff was very nice. They were able to take my reservation an hour before my ride and had what I needed in house. I showed up and within 10 minutes had my bike, an emergency  kit (C02 cartridges, tire, tools), and a route map for the area that could be modified to meet my needs. \n\nWHAT A RIDE! Ok, so it was not NAPA, but you cannot expect that in the desert. Some great landscapes, some steady elevation gains, some quiet roads, some wildlife (rabbits mainly), and a gorgeous sunny day in March. It just doesn't get much better than that .\n\nI cannot rate this place on their tours or their team building, but I will most definitely be back to rent a road bike when I am in the Scottsdale area. I will make sure that I make a reservation in advance, though, since this rare find is likely to leak out ! Cant wait to come back and ride again later in the year!!!

Please read throughout as I will log my entire experience/moms experience.   I also should note any cons likely will be more descriptive just because I want to notate the specifics of these.\n\n\nPros:  Just about every nurse has come in with genuine care for my mom.  I feel like they have tried to develop a rapport.\n          My mom enjoys the food, which cannot be discounted when in pain.\n         The hospital itself I actually feel is quite nice.\n         They have hyperbarics to aid with wounds.\n\nCons:  The utmost con was a male nurse who showed a complete lack of compassion for my mother.  What I will be describing will tie in to other  cons.  My mom is experiencing the worse pain of her entire life and a sweet older female nurse is apologizing for being an hour late on the meds ( to happen every 3 hours bp permitting).  This disgusting individual (a male nurse I will withhold name due to fear of retaliation on my mom) says to the female don't apologize you're not that late.  My mom is in tears and convulsing and you throw away her pain.  I confronted him and was told he was doing his job and they have never been late.  Got a printout of meds and there were some severe inconsistencies.  So first deplorable bedside manner then being called a liar is stomach turning.  I have not seen him back and better not.\n        Secondly there is a lot of confusion.  The nurses and doctors do not seem to communicate. Talk of her going home although she need weeks of hyperbaric and likely more surgery.  People uncertain about meds and treatments.\n\n 10/5 update:  Head of nursing met with my dad and reviewed in details my moms case.  Looks like we are known in the hospital.  Not sure if that is a good thing but everyone is being quite attentive and explaining what's going on.  Just looking out for my mom.\n\n Second review today.  I met with the Chief Clinical Officer of the hospital who explained the wound my mom has is more severe than perhaps had been realized so time had been spent talking to the staff on all ends detailing this. The willingness and desire to meet with us was a sign that the goal is for the care to be the best possible,  and I feel much better about her time here.  It was a display of the utmost of professionalism and caring.\n\nWell just as we thought things were better here is update three.  My mom went near 4.5 hours without any pain aid after being assured this would not happen. She did get a shot of insulin and quite a few checks if she had finished her dinner. When I asked a nurse they said they'd be right back. I have been told her wound is severe and infected.  I have taken off a couple weeks from work to be here and need to head back Sunday.  After I felt this level of reassurance from the Chief office I'm back to where I was yesterday.  My greatest fear is at three in the morning she will be writhing in pain from an above the knee amputation and there will be excuses as to why she just had to suck it up the pain.  I don't like hearing that so and so did not know about her wound or pain med schedule.", 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'pkHjHIoog1jiKzZp0NWzQg'}

It's tucked away with some factories and construction, somewhere in the general area of 885 and Sandcastle and a place called GalvTech.  There are small signs, which you kind of need to follow if you want to find this place.\n\nAnd trust me, you WANT to find this place!\n\nWe decided to check it out because my dad mentioned that it's always packed on Lenten Fridays.

I read something comparing him to his compatriots Bob Seger (who has long retired), John Mellencamp (who is getting back to his roots) and John Fogerty.

Joe & company weren\'t backing up Bruce.  It was the 15th anniversary of their joint CD "American Babylon" and a lot of songs last night were from that album.  The group launched into "American Babylon" and also did "Never Be Enough Time" and my favorite, "Homestead".  I really like that song \'cos it gives you the history of the Homestead Works and now the irony is there\'s a big box center on the site where you can buy goods made in China.  They also played the seminal favorite, "Talk to the King".\n\nSpringsteen fans weren\'t disappointed though \'cos the band also did "Thunder Road", "Atlantic City", and "Fire".  For those fans of Grushecky\'s old band, the Iron City Houserockers, they did "Pumping Iron, Sweating Steel".  \n\nI\'ve never figured out how these two guys know each other, but they are old friends and it certainly showed on stage last night.

I went this afternoon for some fish sandwiches for lunch.\n\nFirst of all, the volunteers at the fish fry are so nice.  Everyone was friendly and chatty, and super helpful.  Apparently, St. Regis is a bilingual church, so there were menus in English and Spanish, and people who spoke both to assist.\n\nSecond, the food was just awesome.  The fish sandwiches are huge and come separated if you order them to-go, so that way your bread isn't soggy by the time you get it home. The breading is so sweet and buttery in flavor, but surprisingly light-feeling.  Each fish sandwich comes with a little cup of juicy/crispy coleslaw, a pile of tartar and ketchup packets, a can of pop AND two cookies for dessert!  All of this was only $6 per serving.\n\nWe also got a tray of their pierogies, which are available for $5 a dozen in a variety of 5-6 stuffings.  The pierogies are Gosia's, so not made in-house, but still a homemade, local institution.  We haven't cooked them up yet, but it is something we are looking forward to.\n\nThis year, I'm trying to break out of my comfort zone of going to St. Veronica's (now Good Samaritan) in Ambridge for a fish fry, and I'm glad I checked out St. Regis.

Plenty of merchandise stands too, as well as a well-stocked, if eternally crowded shop.\n\nThe fans are great (OK, I'll admit that I might be a little biased here, but the atmosphere was electric), the staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly, and it all added up to the perfect visit to my mecca of hockey.  A rink full of history, Mellon Arena represents the good 'old' days of hockey, and represents those days with style and grace - thanks for the good times, the memories, and here's hoping for a few more before it is sadly put to rest.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'cJcX0YR9gvptdFy2tF3ylg'}

But looks are deceptive and this place goes back and in depth.\n\nThe Fort Pitt Museum is located in a re-created 18th century bastion of the fort that Great Britain built in 1759, after it captured the Point from the French; the outline of the French Fort Duquesne, built in 1754, is nearby. The Museum focuses on the French and Indian War but also addresses such topics as the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, and the founding of the city of Pittsburgh. \n\nThey have a fur trader\'s cabin, a barracks room, and an artillery room to demonstrate what early life at the Point was like.  Upstairs, they have built a new exhibit on the long war between France and Great Britain, with special emphasis on the role that the Point and Fort Pitt itself played. Many original documents and artifacts are displayed. \n\nThey have a couple of upcoming exhibits here that I would like to see.  One is Prelude to Victory: Grant\'s Defeat and it will be on September 13, 2008.  The other will be "The Hinge of History: The Forks of the Ohio Changes Hands".

I decided to pack up my laptop and bring her to the Myers Park library branch yesterday to focus and be productive outside of my house.\n\nHere\'s the thing about the major changes with the Char/Meck library systems as of late, because of the budget squeezes, funding cuts and closings around the county, the libraries are really full at really odd times.

This particular branch is pretty small and doesn\'t have a ton of "working" space. Plus, because many of the other (larger) branches are closed on Tuesdays, the Myers Park branch gets a ton of their overflow. \n\nThus, the library was chock full of kids, Internet surfers and folks coming in and out to use their services. I take no issue with the crowded factor, as this branch is clearly serving its community and its needs. Yay for that! Just keep it in mind that this may not be as quiet as you think!\n\nThe folks who work here are very, very sweet and helpful. Not only did they help me find a few books for an upcoming beach trip, but I also overhead them helping anyone and everyone with a question or issue. As previously mentioned, there is a bank of individual cubbies for the working bees and a few tables near the back if you\'re lucky enough to score one. Literature wise, this is a small branch. But I highly recommend searching for your books online and you can request that the be put on hold at whichever branch you like. Thus, whichever library that has said book(s) will send them over to the Myers Park branch (or whichever branch you designate online) and they will notify you when they are ready to be picked up. Stroll on over to the branch, pick up your books, hit up the self-checkout and poof! Instant literature bliss.\n\nA few other things to note about this particular location: the parking is easy but can be tight when they are busy. They offer free WiFi and have a small, but diverse, selection of magazines and media at your disposal. Here\'s hoping that the county figures it out and supports our library structure as a whole.

I\'ve got a Trek bike (and a few other non-Treks), so I was pleased to find a "factory" store so close to my house.  \n\nI wandered in not for a bike, but for some accessories (clothing and a recovery supplement).  The store is big, open, well lit, and airy.  It feels comfortable - not really like a bike shop, but more like a modern coffee shop.  \n\nAnd that\'s about the end of the positive experience.  I found it very difficult to find things - I was immediately drawn to a rack of jerseys that were marked as 50% off.  I went to look for some bib shorts and discovered that I was actually shopping in the women\'s section... it wasn\'t real clear at first.\n\nSo I walked over to the men\'s side and browsed the clothing.  Didn\'t find anything in my size (there were tons of XXLs and Smalls, but not much else)... I asked one of the employees if they had any Optygen (a recovery supplement) and I got a blank stare.\n\nI coaxed an answer by saying, "EFS says that this is the only authorized Madison retailer for Optygen - I called them and verified on their website that you guys are \'it\' in Madison."\n\nThe kid said, "Um, I don\'t think we have that - we do have some Hammer Gel or Clif Blocks, though."  \n\nEnergy gels aren\'t the same as a recovery supplement... so I asked, "Can you show me where the supplements are?"\n\nAgain, I got a blank stare, and then we walked over by the water bottle display which also had some recovery mixes and energy gels.  No dice - no EFS products.\n\nWe talked a bit about the EFS stuff and eventually another guy came over and said he could probably order it, but that the store hadn\'t carried any EFS for "a really long time."  Ok - that\'s cool.  I\'ll order it from Amazon, use my Prime shipping and have it tomorrow...\n\nOn a whim, I called the Endurance House to see if they had EFS.

It finally took a phone call from another nursing facility to find out they were not going to accept my friend.  I have to wonder why they couldn't have told me directly. There were other places I could have been investigating and would have sooner.   Also, when they decide to not accept a person they immediately destroy all the paperwork involved so don't expect to get any reason why.  This is information that could help a person with other placement.\n\nI ended up in the hospital on Thanksgiving.  While I was waiting for an MRI at 4 in the morning, I got to talking to the technician.  I mentioned having a friend who is in assisted living and how I was trying to place her someplace permanently.  I asked her directly what it was like when it came to bringing in residents from the Beatitudes for testing.  Ever seen a person ready to scream when they want to and can't.  There was complete silence for about a minute.   The person told me that he/she could be fired for what he/she was going to tell me but she did not care.  If a patient was scheduled from the beatitudes for testing it was common knowledge that they might or might not arrive at the proper time. When the technician would finally have to call the Beatitudes concerning the person who hadn't arrive, one got the very clear impression that if the person got there or not was really of no great importance.\n\nAs I said before, I had heard great things about the Beatitudes.

The official told me to stand in line and then later the security guard said they would start screening people with appointments first. This caused a frenzy as people got out of line who had one and those that did not and did not know they needed one got mad and started arguing with security. \n\n* Don\'t bring a jacket I don\'t care how cold it is as any little thing will set off the metal detector so you will have to take it off and any jewelry, watch, phone, keys, belt, etc. \n\nI still set the damn thing off each time I went back (and I had to go back three times as they kept making me get copies of this and copies of that) \n\n* As soon as you get in the building go to "information" nowhere in this building does it say that you need to get a number from them, have them inspect your forms and wait for that number to be called even if you have an appointment. \n\nWhen the official asked me how long I wanted the passport for I said "The longer the better so I don\'t have to come back to this place"...OK I didn\'t say that but I was thinking it. \n\nEnjoy your friendly local consulate. \n\nViva Mexico.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'pefVcILrG0JCD6YeS37s6Q'}

Once there, I had to play "musical windows" with the ER personnel processing paperwork.  The waiting area was very small and dark.

Instead, I saw a Physician\'s Aid, who put me in an arm sling, wrote out prescriptions and sent me on my way???\n\nLater that month, I was admitted for Outpatient Surgery.  Long story short:  1) A Security Guard escorted me to an empty, dark lobby where I waited for the Outpatient Team to arrive.  Upon Admission (and I discovered days later after the surgery), I discovered that I\'d been given another patient\'s paperwork.  2) Two nurses were unable to find a vein for the I.V. (after 10 sticks. Mind you I couldn\'t eat or drink before surgery) and the third nurse (who used an Ultrasound machine) dug that needle in so hard that I have a long streaked black and blue mark.  Overall, you can count all 10 sticks between both arms.  3) Why did the nurse ask me what I was allergic or had intolerance to, only for my Doctor to write me a prescription for the very drug that I\'m intolerant to?

Their mission statement is: "Pure Heart Christian Fellowship is a family of Christ followers committed to being a church where love is felt, lives are changed, the Holy Spirit is embraced and the world is engaged."\n\nFrom the peaceful grounds surrounding the campus to the staff, this is a place that welcomes everyone regardless of where they are on their journey. The members are a mix of all backgrounds, many of whom left their previous churches because they were looking for someplace that felt more connected to their everyday struggles or experienced judgments that made them uncomfortable.\n\nThe services are contemporary and diverse. The pastoral staff is recognized throughout the nation as one that excels in bringing messages of relevance and importance to the community. And the greatest thing is that this is all done with a healthy dose of humor and relatability. There is seldom a week that I leave thinking that somehow the message had been directed solely to me.\n\nOne of my favorite things is their community outreach programs. Whether it be feeding the hungry, participating in habitat for humanity, handing out water during the summer, or providing free gift wrapping during the holidays, their sole aim is to let people know that they are not alone in life. Regardless of your interests there is a place for you to become involved in a community of caring individuals that believe if you are not part of making the world a better place, you are not living to your fullest potential.\n\nI would encourage anyone looking for someplace that you can explore your own spiritual beliefs in a non-confrontational manner to check it out one weekend.\n\nhttp://www.pureheart.org/index.php', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'iwWBF3nKoRMoy1sbkLJwvg'}

Like generic, corporate hotels. That  "there is no life in this room because we have sterilized it of everything, even personality" smell. \n\nWhen my mother was scheduled for surgery at Maryvale, I was a little worried. My hang-ups with hospitals aside, Maryvale is just an unpleasant place to be. I once had a gun pulled on me while dropping off a library book. \n\nIt takes a very special brand of stupidity to motivate someone to mugging. Any other idiot would have realized that the book I was holding was worth more than the 2 dollars in change in my pockets.\n\nGetting to the hospital was a fucking travesty. There are like ten openings in the parking lot but only one viable entrance. \n\nAll the the entrances to the hospitals are lined up on the same driveway. So I nearly got plowed by an ambulance while dropping my mother off to check in. \n\nI don\'t want to sound nit-picky, but if you\'ve got a guy in your vehicle who\'s spleen is hanging out, maybe you should have your own lane. Maybe.\n\nWhat was originally scheduled for a one-hour outpatient procedure became a three-hour ordeal as both the anesthesiologist AND the surgeon were both stuck in traffic.\n\nThis required long periods of sitting in the SCU waiting room, watching Governor Blagojevich\'s career go down in flames on MSNBC as I stared at the vending machine and asked myself whether I would rather kill myself with Twix or chili cheese fritos. \n\nI ended up deciding on twizzlers.\n\nWhile I waited for some word on my mother\'s condition I was visited by ssomething-like-but-not-necessarily a hospitality coordinator. She tried so hard to get me to take some of the cookies or coffee in her cart, but I was just too nervous to eat. \n\nNot surprisingly, she was the only staff member who seemed at all concerned with keeping me calm and informed.\n\nWhen I would walk up to the counter to see if I could get a status update on my mother, the receptionist would sigh, look up from her paper snowflakes project and look at me as if I just shit in her corn flakes.\n\nOh, I\'m sorry, I didn\'t mean to ruin your tacky holiday reverie. Just curious, you know, if my mother, who should\'ve been out of surgery TWO HOURS AGO, is doing okay. Silly me. I\'ll go back to the waiting room. I\'m really curious to see how that bailout works out.\n\nWhile I waited for some word I went to the cafeteria. \n\nIt\'s worthy to note that the ground floor of Marvyale Hospital is floor 2, not floor 1.\n\nSo I spent twenty minutes wandering around looking for something to eat and only finding radiology and urology labs. \n\nThat shit doesn\'t even make sense to me, and I lived in Europe for most of my childhood.\n\nI didn\'t get anything in the cafeteria, as the grill had closed. When I went to pay for my cup of horchata, the doctor in front of me let me pass him. \n\n"Are you sure, man? I don\'t want to make your break even shorter than I imagine it is."\n"Actually, this is the only way I GET a break. The sooner I pay for that and eat it, the sooner I gotta get back up there."\n\nAs phobic as I am of doctors, even I find it a little retarded that the asshole scrambling eggs in the cafeteria gets a longer break than the guy saving lives.\n\nWhen one of the nurses sought me out, I was given a sheet of all the things I would have to watch out for. \n\nKeep up liquids, check. Call if there\'s any tingling sensation while urinating...uh, check. No sexual intercourse.\n\nYOU ARE AWARE THAT I AM HER DAUGHTER, RIGHT?\n\nThis awkward odyssey ends three hours later than it should have, with me driving my doped up mother home and then leaving her there while I finished up with my finals. \n\nIn the end of all this, I can be grateful about one thing; when I eventually get my SRS done, it WILL NOT be at Maryvale Hospital.', 'stars': 2, 'user_id': 'o1HQEND6cg-4SK0Z1ASBMQ'}

Of course this only fair, but if you get there first, you should have first dibs on getting the dog you want instead of having to wait for a drawing.\n\nIf your looking for a dog or cat, I highly recommend visiting the Humane Society\'s Campus for Compassion and their other adoption center at 13th Ave. & Hatcher.

I hadn\'t gone to church for over ten years and didn\'t really plan on going back. Then, my four year old told me, "Mommy, I want to go to church." Like all parents nowadays I decided to totally let my child run my life and dictate where we go....ok, ok not really he did say that and he and I had a discussion about what he thought people did a church (sing songs and eat cookies) and what went on there. It really got me thinking about spirituality and religion and such. \n\nSo, I started the search for a church. I was looking for a church in which my whole family would feel comfortable. I was looking for some place that was open to all and did not discriminate. I was also looking for a church that did not make me feel like I had to either send my child away or sit in an enclosed place so the adults could worship in peace. I started my search on-line and went to several churches websites. I found one that seemed to meet all the criteria, but I was skeptical. I figured we\'d give it two services and then try another and then another and then eventually just give up and go back to sleeping in on Sundays. \n\nFrom the moment I walked in I felt like this was a different kind of church. The people who greeted us at the front door were so friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy we were there. Pastor Paul gave a sermon that I felt was very relevant to me and what was going on in the world. I felt very comfortable and so did the rest of my family. We never ended up going to check out other churches although it did take us several months to decide to actually commit to DHC, not because we were unsure, but because it seemed like such a huge commitment and I didn\'t want to jump into anything. The DHC members we have met are so nice and caring. It\'s a church that takes God seriously but not themselves. So, if you are looking for a church that is inclusive of everyone and feels like a place you are wanted and cared about. I highly recommend Desert Heritage Church. \n\nP.S.

When we visited about 10 years ago, we were lucky enough to get the full tour by the last living member of the founding couple. She told us stories of starting the place in the 30s, how it used to be a trading post, then adding the motel and museum, having javelina roasts for the Giants who came there for mineral bath retreats before their season began. The mineral baths are closed now, but they still operate the motel and the wildlife museum - an all in one sort of spot. \n\nThis place is very hard to translate into words that can do it justice... Simply put: it\'s stuck in time. Late 1940s, early 50s to be exact. It literally is frozen in that era. It\'s a vast feast for the eyes: every direction offers something else to gaze upon and investigate... Indian pottery, hand-painted "Swedish Massage" signs, a taxidermy wolf, a Jesus lamp, etc., etc. When we were there, the first thing we noticed, besides it being empty and fully vacant, was its cleanliness. It was immaculate - everything, from the baths and the rooms to the lobby and even the aging taxidermy animals on display. That brings me to the second thing we noticed: the museum. The mounted specimens are, or were, primarily of local (southwestern US) origin, from bison and coyote to roadrunner and your run-of-the-mill two-headed sheep. Ted Sliger prepared many of the animals himself, which were pretty darn good for a self-taught taxidermist. If this stuff gives you the creeps, it\'s like Norman Bates\' back room on steroids. If you enjoy this sort of spectacle, well... enjoy! You won\'t be seeing it replicated in many places around the country. These amazing wildlife trophy collections are being forgotten, or worse, scrapped as the old-timers die off and descendants don\'t know what to do with the handiwork of their grandparent\'s idle time.\n\nI told the RA guys of this out of the way mirage of an establishment a few years ago, so I\'m happy to see they finally visited and reviewed it. I need to get back there once more. If venturing through the southwest, you ought to check it out, too, before it vanishes.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'UvgByu7n9WFp_3ShPYVv6A'}

Something that I wasn't quite used to. \n\nMajority of the parishioners were of retired age. There were a few young families with babies and toddlers, but they were hardly seen in the crowds.\n\nSo how modern is this church? Well they've installed 3 projectors and screens (one for each side of the church to view during mass) for videos or presentations given during the mass. I must say, this is not typically seen in your traditional church.\n\nEveryone here was kind and friendly.

Concert-style worship with an amazingly talented worship team on stage, dim lights, brightly colored spotlights, two large video broadcast screens with song lyrics overlaid on live video. Announcements were all done on video.\n\nThe sermon was presented by guest speaker Bill Butterworth of Southern California (http://www.billbutterworth.com/) who delivered a solid message with great foundations. I felt it was geared more towards newer believers (and service was also very short), but I don't mind that at all. The message was clear and easy to understand and remember, which is important.\n\nIf I lived in Las Vegas, I would probably put this church high on my list of churches to check out again and possibly become a member of! Highly recommended, especially for newer believers looking for a place to seek God and learn how to get grounded in the Bible. It sounds like there's a lot of ways to get involved with the church family too!", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': '2ThogyfqUnLoRiG-n03b0g'}

A little girl in the congregation yelled, "It\'s a Boy, mommy!" Imagine the photos his Facebook page.  They have the usual Sunday services, weddings, funerals, communions, and confirmations...but lots of other special events. \n\nThis is the church that is closest to my relatives that live here.  I like the simplicity of this building design.  It was first built to be a gymnasium for a school. Instead, they put some cushioned meeting chairs in tight rows. They put an altar in, a speaker system, and decorations, and voila, there is a church.  And, there are no kneelers! YAY! I remember hating churches where they have wood kneelers with no padding.  If you didn\'t have bad knees, you might get them.  But not here. \n\nThe priests are just like any other Catholic church.  They love to give long sermons.  That\'s the same wherever you go. In the beginning of any service, they announce that people must turn off their cell phones, to stop talking, and get into a prayerful mood. Since they have no kneelers, and space is tight, they make EVERYONE go up to communion.  If you are not a Catholic, or don\'t want to partake in communion, you still go up but the priest will just give you a blessing. What\'s really cool is that if you\'re unable to walk up, tell the usher before hand and the usher will ask the priest will come to you.  It\'s that intimate.\n\nThe music is done by a husband and wife team.  They and the choir members sound pretty good.  He\'s got a kind of showt une Vegas style - Ave Maria never sounded so different.  And if you were here in 2007 and noticed a 250 lb. guy leading the music, he\'s that same guy but lost about 100 pounds along the way, and he doesn\'t even look like the same person.      \n\nThey do a lot of cool outreach for the community.  They have a food bank for the poor families in the area. The volunteers have to be screened.  It gets sad when there are so many families in dire finances that they can\'t even eat.  But there are the volunteers who work long hours one day a week for this.  They also have a donations only coffee and donuts area, and my relatives seem to know a lot of people.  This is a very friendly place if you are sociable.  \n\nThe last thing I\'ll say is that this church really is a mixed race church that has lots of Filipinos, Caucasians, Latins, Blacks, and everything in between.  And they really do get along. After church, Denny\'s, McDona\'d\'s, IHOP, and Aliante Casino are all less than 3 miles away.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'Icjho-pebXEplw0vRwAcsw'}

They were however happy to review pictures I had take of my house layout and color scheme I took, and suggest items for certain parts of my home based on the pictures.

But no!  There is art to be found in the City of Sin... you just have to know where to look.  For example, the Wynn Casino.\n\nSteve Wynn, if you didn\'t know, is not only mind-bogglingly rich but also a patron of the arts, and a major art collector.  Some of the paintings he has are things you\'d never expect to see outside a museum.  The Wynn Collection came to the Nevada Museum of Art (in Reno) last year, so I saw it then, and was impressed.  When the Wynn casino opened, the collection initially had its own gallery, nestled off the main floor near the shops, which Nevada residents could get into for $3, making it one of the few genuine bargains in Vegas.\n\nBut since money is, after all, the prime consideration, the gallery was closed earlier this year due to poor ticket sales, and the space will be converted into retail space for more of the couture brands that already grace the Wynn\'s shopping mall.  Fortunately, the art itself didn\'t go away, and the pieces have been redistributed around the casino, with the showpiece - Picasso\'s "Le Reve" - displayed in the main lobby.\n\nI haven\'t seen the collection since it was taken out of the gallery, but it\'s an impressive selection of pieces by Warhol, Singer, van Gogh, Manet, Gaugin, and Jan Brueghel the Younger, among others.  If you have the patience and stamina for a casino-wide scavenger hunt, this is likely the best free show you\'ll see in Vegas.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'SuzSrMWoycf4DXL_DMMdNg'}

His works are amazing.\n\nI attended the private opening night gala for Everhart's new exhibition at this gallery and they did a superb job of hosting the event.  The gallery is very spacious and has a private viewing room to see individual pieces in different tones of light.  The sales people are very knowledgeable and know the background of every artist and every piece that's on display.  I will admit that some of the sales people can be a bit pushy, but they're true art enthusiasts and expect those interested in the pieces to be the same.\n\nWhile their current exhibition is Everhart's latest, they usually have various artist's works on display, and not just one artist.  However with Everhart's fame and incredible work, they tend to showcase his work the most.\n\nThis stuff isn't cheap that's for sure but it's definitely nice to see if you're a fan or just love art.  Their exhibits usually show the originals like the ones at the gala I went to.. Originals were going for as low as $8K, all the way up to $250K.

Since there are only 20 people in the class at one time, you are split up into groups of five with an instructor. Your instructor then does a walk-around the actual stock car you will be driving. Then you get into a nice air-conditioned van which drives around the track to give you pointers on where your driving line should be on the track and other helpful tips.\n\nNext comes the best part, driving the cars!!!  Each student gets to driver there own vehicle. They control your speed on the track by the student has to follow the instructor in his car. As you pull out onto the track, you just follow what the instructor does. As he goes faster, so do you. In you first session, you complete 8 laps and come back in. After you get out of your car, the instructor goes over your driving, gives your lap times and give you any instructions on how to improve. After that, you get to go out again for another 10 laps at higher speeds. If you instructor feels you can go faster, he will increase his speed. The only problem is that they will not let you go over 140mph!!\n\nOnce you complete your 10 laps, you pull back into the pits and finish up. After the class is completed, they have a little graduation ceremony which everyone receives a nice looking certificate and a printout of all of you lap times.\n\nEverything about this experience was top-notch. The instructors, facilities and equipment where excellent. The souvenir shop that they have have a nice assortment of things to purchase to help you commemorate your experience.\n\nSome might think that $799.00 is to expensive for this kind of experience.

He came by a while later to ask if the medication for my nausea was working, which it wasn't. So he switched me to something else. I didn't see him again for another few hours, when he just told me that I could go home when I wanted.

And they also have trampolines on the side walls too!  This is your chance to try all those aerial stunts you wanted to try as a kid.  You can jump onto the wall, do a flip and just keep on jumping!  They even offer 3-D Dodgeball and hoops for you to try to fly through.\r\n\r\nI found myself here on a Sunday night after my friend suggested this idea months before.  Sure, I've done my share of trampoline jumping in someone's backyard.  But this setup, you just can't find in someone's yard.  So, there I was practicing my front and back somersaults.  And sure, I ate it a few times...everyone needs a few good face plants every now and then.

(At our age, we figure an hour was plenty and it was!  It's gets super tiring jumping!)  On the hour and the half, they blow their whistle reminding those who have finished their session that they time is up.  This is when they make everyone take a mini break on the sides until everyone who is supposed to be off is gone.  And then you can resume to your jumping pleasures!   \r\n\r\nYeah, sure...I did ask my friend if we were the oldest ones there and we were.  But so what?!  We had a fabulous time nonetheless and agreed that it would have made a fantastic date spot!  See if you can drag a bunch of your friends along with you.  I'm sure it'll make it that much more fun! \r\n\r\nSide note: With no lockers, I suggest you leave mostly everything in your car or at home (hotel).  You can leave your keys/wallet at the front, but it gets jumbled up with everyone else's keys/wallets.  Bring water, Gatorade, etc. because you will need it!

I wandered why they would serve something messy like nachos that requires your fingernails getting all up into the cheese, and then having people touch various paperwork to proceed with whatever reason they are the DMV in the first place.  As I waited, the BF showed up with chicken nuggets (more finger foods), lots of messy dipping sauces,and a yogurt parfait from the nearby McD's down the street.  This definitely helps that you can leave briefly and come back without missing your number.  (I stayed anyways...just in case!)  \n\nWhen I saw A524 come up, I headed to window 7.

I don't recall anything extraordinary at the concessions and - while they have local beer (always a plus) - Pittsburgh's local beers pre-date the microbrew revolution (translation: taste like domestic swill).\n\nSo what won me over?  Two words: the view.\n\nBehind the outfield stands lies the most beautiful view I've seen outside a stadium.  In Pittsburgh?  I know!  They picked the perfect spot for the stadium.  It looks out upon the Allegheny River which cuts through Pittsburgh and merges with the Monongahela to create the Ohio River.  (geography is hot, huh?).  This convergence is the primary reason why Pittsburgh became a city and why their old stadium was called Three Rivers Stadium.\n\nThe river provides a target for left handed batters who can reach it with a long blast over the high right field fence - very reminiscent of Barry Bond's new home in San Francisco (at AT&T formerly SBC and before that Pac Bell Park).  As the river extends out beyond center field, you can see the closest of three identical yellow steel suspension bridges.  These bridges dutifully represent the city in construction (steel - this is the Iron City and home to the Steelers), color (both the Pirates and Steelers have yellow in their uniforms), and number (three, like the # of rivers).  \n\nThe closest bridge is named after the great Pirate right fielder Roberto Clemente who was a hero both on and off the field (he died in a plane crash in 1972 at 38 on the way to help Nicaraguan earthquake victims).    It's closed to car traffic during game nights so you can park across the river and walk over.  Really nice.  (interesting enough, one of the other bridges is named after Pittsburgh's own Andy Warhol - I wonder if pop art kids sit on this bridge eating Campbell's Soup listening to the first Velvet Underground album).\n\nBeyond the river lies the Pittsburgh skyline.  If it's not grander than, say, the NY skyline from the Circle Line, but it sure beats the skyline you see beyond Yankee (the Bronx) and Shea (parking lot).\n\nIf you ever have a chance to see a game here, do it.

It\'s sort of a Peter Piper Pizza on \'Roids, complete with Laser Tag, Bumper Cars, and a Bowling Alley. combined with a Salad/Pizza buffet. There is also a bar serving beer, wine and \'Rita\'s (it may possibly be full service)\n\nWhile Amazing Jake\'s caters to group events like birthday parties, anyone can walk in an plop down a hunk of cash to eat, drink and play. There are multiple themed rooms where you can enjoy  your meal. Some of the rooms included a movie room, showing kids movies, two rooms with sports themes, and a few others. Buffet prices are about what you\'d pay anywhere, $7.99 per adult for unlimited buffet, $3.99 or $4.99 for the little kids. The birthday party price is $9.95 per kid and includes unlimited soft drinks, the buffet, 10 tokens per guest, a room and a server.\n\nOf course, don\'t put your wallet away quite yet. Every attraction has an individual price, or you can purchase unlimited use wristbands, the pricing for that (I think) is $5.95 for the little kids attractions and $10.95 for most everything (bowling is extra). The a la carte prices are pretty steep in comparison (e.g. $5.25 for a single Go cart ride), so I\'d recommend the wristband.\n\nOne very important thing to know about your Amazing Jake\'s birthday party is that while parents are allowed in to drop and pick up their children, if they stay the length of the party you will be charged a buffet for each parent. Some of the attending parents knew this, others didn\'t. I would suggest that if this s important to you that you somehow make sure the parents know the deal..\n\nReview:\nThe reservation process went smoothly, we made our reservations on site (I think you can also do so on-line and by phone) and were handed a set of invitations, with the instruction to arrive 15 minutes early. We chose to have our party at 10AM, a little early, but we had other things going on that day. We arrived at 9:40 and the doors were locked. After a few minutes we were allowed in and asked to wait. We then spent the next 15 minutes waiting at the entrance lobby while our room was prepared. I do not understand why they could not have been a little more organized for the first group of the day. None the less, we were shown in to our room that was nicely decorated. We had been warned that we might end up sharing our room, and in fact we did end up doing so. My wife asked if we could have the location where we could see most of the arcade area, and we were informed that we could not. Off to a bad start.\n\nYou are invited to stay at Jake\'s all day, but for your birthday party, you only have the reserved room for 90 minutes. We chose to allow the kids to play for 45 minutes and then site them down for pizza, cake and gifts. This strategy worked well enough, except that locating the 10 kids in this warehouse was a bit of a chore, and the kids in laser tags would be in there about 10 minutes at a time. I managed to have the kids located in about 10 minutes, leaving us only 35 minutes left to eat and scoot.\n\nOK, the food: \n- They offer three soups, I enjoyed the roasted Tomato and the Thai Chicken. Both were very good\n- They offer three or four pasta dishes, I had a little bit of Cajun Penne that was nicely spicy\n- The salad bar was complete and fresh\n- I had one slice of pizza which I thought was unremarkable. The sauce was bland, as was the pepperoni. I would give them good marks for the variety of pizza\'s they offered.\n- There was a wide selection of desserts, which I managed to avoid\n\nI keep thinking about Sweet Tomatoes as I review the offerings here, it is quite similar.\n\nAll went well, our server was quite helpful, bringing in pizza and pitchers of drinks for the kids, lighting the cake, cutting and handing out the cake. and of course, picking up our mess :) Midway through our visit, she approached us, apologized for the early confusion, and gave us a bag of 200 tokens for our trouble. Ahh, now we are feeling better...\n\nBut wait, the boys are telling us that they were not allowed on the bumper cars because they had the wrong wristband! We paid the $10.95 fee, what was the deal? My wife spoke to the bumper car operator, who gave the predictable "Uh, it wasn\'t me" response. My wife complained about this to one of the managers, who gave us a credit for $95! Holy cow!\n\nConclusions:\nOur cost, after a couple of extra adults, 7 big kids and two smaller kids came to about $225. Adding the tip for the hostess it came to about $25/person. That\'s not dirt cheap, but compared to other parties we\'ve had, it is pretty competitive with renting a bounce and doing it at your house. \n\nI could really see getting together with another dad or two and taking the kids there in the evening, enjoying a beer or two in one of the sports rooms while they kids run around. I\'m guessing that\'s where my $95 credit is going to go.', 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'SYb1tpWN2_L029FSnAYXBQ'}

Everything there is immense: a shopping center has a hundred stores, a hotel lobby has a thousand slot machines and a variety of other betting opportunities. To get from our hotel room to the street took about fifteen minutes each day. Then, to get from the street to another hotel where we could eat something took at least twenty minutes of brisk New York walking. All to say that Vegas can be a tiring place. \n\nLuckily, the Deuce changes everything. If you know their slogan and say it over and over to yourself when you\'re bored in an elevator or on your way to sleep, like I do, you\'ll know how it works:\n\nHave fun, stay out of the sun. Ride the Deuce--two dollars one way, five dollars all day. Exact change required. \n\n(I guess if you knew what "deuce" meant you\'d also have an idea of the pricing.) \n\nThe Deuce makes stops along the strip at all the hotels and comes pretty frequently. It runs, obviously, at all hours. For all this, though, I feel I am being generous by giving it four stars. Here\'s why: Though in Vegas you can play blackjack with a hooker on your lap or get married in a food court, YOU CANNOT BRING BEVERAGES ONTO THE BUS. And I\'m not talking about a can of beer here; I mean coffee. With a top on it. That cost three dollars b/c of the insane price inflation in Vegas. \n\nI was informed of this insane rule (and forced to throw out my newly purchased coffee) by the Transit Ambassador for the Deuce, who was standing at the bus stop watching people board the bus at 11 a.m. one day.

I didn\'t know I\'d want a camera so badly when playing mini-golf, but oh my oh my....\n\nHistory of the place - it used to be a Popular but they went under many many moons ago.  It sat vacant for quite a few years, but it was then bought out by this company that does indoor mini-golf.  I wasn\'t impressed w/ the idea when I lived in the area, so I never went.  What a silly girl I was.  \n\nLittle kids are going to love this place.  Slightly bigger kids will think it\'s silly, but eventually the golf will take over enough of their attention.  Adults will have a completely different experience.  This place would be 6 star if there was a bar.  I\'m telling you.  There IS a bar in the same parking lot and I\'m thinking that we might just have to make that happen next time.  \n\nThe place is one big open area with 18 holes of indoor mini-golf.  That\'s right - Air conditioned mini-golf for those Phoenix summers.  But Kristin, you may be asking, how is that over the top?  Well, I could just direct you to the web site, but let me start with 2 words - Jungle Theme.  Yes, that\'s right.  Jungle theme. Giant plaster jungle animals are everywhere.  And a horse.  And a giant leaping dolphin.  Fake banana trees with mini-monkeys in the trees.  Oh yes.  It is that good.  \n\nPricing per round: Adult - $6, Kids 2-6 and seniors - $5, Kids 3 and under are free!  But that\'s not all! They also have a row of those cheesy rides kids love that are in front of supermarkets that don\'t really go anywhere.  They also have a room to the side with 15 "video game" stations - all games rated E.  But wait - there\'s more!  If you live at all in the area and you have a kid - this is totally worth it - for $20/month they can have UNLIMITED mini-golf and video games!  And did I mention this is right near a Taco Bell?  Talk about cheap summer fun!  And for us non-child folks - they also have a 2 for 1 Tuesday!\n\nThis place is open from 10am - 8pm, 7 days a week.  If you\'ve got kids - you should take them.  If not - think of this as your Psychedelic Happy Hour.  \n\n[ By the way, I included their "standard" web site above, but I suggest going to http://www.minigolfparadise.com/index_005.htm which you can\'t get to from the main page for some reason.

He gestures to open the window and then it hits me that I recognize the cart. He\'s collecting mail.  As I lower the window he yells "Is it already stamped?".  When I say yes he reaches out his hand and, trusting the guy with the id, the cop and the every so official looking orange vest, I decide to give him our taxes.  He then makes the trek to the car behind me.\n\nBravo USPS!  You are already working late, and working hard as this is one of your busiest times of the year.  But then you go and actually think about your customers enough to have someone waiting before a main turn to eliminate a good chunk of the traffic that would be coming into your location.

No joke.\n\nPhoenix in not a transit-friendly city, and I know that.  I'll digress for a minute.  To take a bus in a sprawling car-dependent city such as ours, most would think that you have no car, are having car problems, are poor, etc.  But in planning for the ultimate wild night out we decided to do the responsible thing and take cabs into Scottsdale.  The next morning I woke up with only $5 in my pocket.  Oops.  It could have been worse -- I could have woken up to a worse surprise. (No snickering.  That is neither here nor there.)\n\nInstead of asking friends to cart me around, the urban explorer in me decided to take the bus.  Why not?  I'm not above it.  I walked over to the bus stop at Scottsdale Fashion Square and waited, and waited.  20 minutes turned into 30.  30 turned into 40.  I called the phone number on the bus stop sign and got some automated service telling me my bus would be there in 18 minutes.  Great!!  A total of one hour.  I probably could have walked the 7 miles home in faster than an hour.   Weekday waits aren't much better.  Your hour wait will lessen to a superconvenient 30 minute wait.  Some express routes (on the freeway and a handful of major roads) run more frequently, but are few and far between.\n\nI've used many bus and rail systems, from the MTA (NY & LA) to the CTA, and BART and Muni.  And Valley Metro probably ranks below all of them. (OK, maybe not that one smelly, filthy Muni bus I rode)   \n\nI might actually ride the bus more frequently if it ran more often.  But understanding that Valley Metro probably operates under simple economics (supply and demand) I don't see them budging to run more frequently if ridership isn't there.  But guess what?  I'm not going to ride buses, if they are that inconvenient.  So there you have it.\n\nOther than that, the bus ride itself seemed to go much quicker than I thought, and wasn't as dirty as other bus systems.  Plus it was only $1.25 to ride.  Hopefully more Phoenix citizens will ride transit - I think that's the only way bus service will improve (not to mention improving traffic and air quality :-))\n\nI'm eager to see how light rail works out, but if it is as disappointing as the bus then count me out.  Shame on us Phoenix.  We deserve better.", 'stars': 2, 'user_id': '4_YfcfHkCem1onJFkItxjA'}

As of now it is the nation\'s fifth largest city (and appears to be nestled in this statistical spot for some time to come) and the metro area ranks 12th... for now. It is likely to jump to 10th by the Arizona Centennial. \n\nIt is the largest city in the region at over 1.5 million residents and over 500 square miles. Founded in 1881 it\'s relatively young even by standards in the Americas. Outside of downtown, especially to the north, neighborhoods clearly transition in age and it is possible to watch decades go by as you move away from downtown. Phoenix is also the cultural and financial heart of the state, with multiple layers of government powers roosting here: city, county, state and federal.\n\nOn the bad side, City of Phoenix leaders tend to string major developments along, which leads to a lot of failed projects, i.e. the Trump Hotel, Metro Lofts, Copper Pointe and many, many more. Had civic leaders allowed for more projects to come to fruition, the city would have a much more Manhattanized appearance in its central core. The city is somewhat bad about historic preservation. Photos from Central Phoenix in 1940 present almost unrecognizable images. At the beginning of Hitchcock\'s "Psycho", you will see Central Phoenix circa 1960, and sadly, very few of those buildings remain. Regardless, the city has made an effort to NOT bulldoze  the old neighborhoods around downtown. However, many of the buildings seen in Central Phoenix were built during/after the mid-60s. \n\nRegardless, some dedicated leaders have striven to catapult the city to its greatest potential and beyond. You can almost see it happening before your eyes, though urban progress is a slow feat. The city has had to compete with other prestigious Valley cities and at times has to work around State of Arizona and Maricopa Country legislation, which may hinder its progress, for example, in 2009 the state hurt bio-tech industries and "green" energy resources through crippling legislation, though Phoenix worked to maintain its existing bio-tech companies and land a new high-capacity solar plant. \n\nIn the end the city is more progressive than many of its suburban counterparts and offers plenty of amenities for locals. Many locals who have transplanted themselves here from elsewhere have not invested, do not invest and will not invest themselves in the city to explore and understand it further. As it works to become more established, more neighborhoods take on a demographic quality and niche, as black, Latino, gay, artistic, family, singles, blue, red, etc. neighborhoods have emerged into distinct parts of town. \n\nLocal or visitor, take some time out to immerse yourself in places outside your neck of the woods, explore, see what more Phoenix has to offer you never knew of before.\n\n*Addendum: To clarify, my rating system on this is meant to reflect how I feel the city is run/operates.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': '9mjItdXixKECanLV6RBIrw'}

What's nice about the Clark County library system is that if your home library doesn't have the book you're looking for (which is about seven times out of ten for Sunrise) you can request it online and it'll be delivered to your home library when it's available. At Sunrise, when your book has arrived, you can get it off the hold-shelf yourself and the check-out process is now all self-serve and electronic. I'm pretty sure it's like that at all Clark COunty libraries now, but really loving this feature at Sunrise because their staff is small (but friendly for the most part) and the line could get pretty backed up. Staff is available for those who aren't self-sufficient or are technologically challenged.\n\nThis is a very child-friendly library with a great children's and young adult section and they often have small group activities and show children's movies here. Schedules can be found online and you can get on the mailing list to get a quarterly newsletter/events calendar for all Clark County events, book clubs, etc. There's also a small art gallery that changes, I believe, quarterly. Nothing's ever struck my interest, however if you're in the area and looking to check out some art, you can pop by Sunrise and take a look at the spread there. \n\nYou can't control the patrons of the establishments you go to, so my only comments on this are, look at the neighborhood, assess and have your mind right and ready when you go here because there are some characters whether they be obnoxious high schoolers there to do anything but check out books and/or study or the elderly man who can't figure out the self-checkout process and verbally assaults the staff member trying to assist him.  \n\nOverall, a decent library with a moderate selection with nice staff and has finally caught up to the 21st with modern check out processes.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'KCQUgDM3vNuB5xn4ZXVo-A'}

Once, a couple of pit bulls ended up in our backyard (twice this happened). They were nice dogs, but since we have two dogs of our own, we could not have them wait for pickup inside our home. We ended up waiting for animal control to pick up these dogs, about four or five hours- which tied up our day. We had them secured in another area, away from our dogs. \n\nWe are responsible pet owners (pick up their feces regularly- this is what we do, when we walk our dogs in public, at parks or around our neighborhood) as well as considerate neighbors. When we had complaints, we found a solution. But alas, we have inconsiderate neighbors who had five small loud barking dogs, at one point (it\'s illegal- you have to have a breeder\'s license now). When there were complaints about them, they claimed that they did not speak English. They\'ve gone down to two dogs, however, they leave them outside in the backyard to bark all hours of the night. I can\'t tell you how many times they\'ve done so- that\'s how frequent (and it so happens to be right outside our bedroom window where their dogs are kept). (When we first moved in, over five years ago, these same neighbors had two huge turkeys, ducks, and more than a dozen chickens and roosters- this is illegal in Las Vegas city limits. If you\'re in an area marked "Horse Property" I think that area of the city is fine with these kinds of animals.) These are the same neighbors who will do handywork in their yard at 6:30 am- I think they believe that other people in the neighborhood are up that early on weekends (or maybe they don\'t care about the noise ordinance law- 7am-10 pm).\n\nHere\'s a summary of the process: complaints are recorded, two complaints are given to the offender, before going to court to file officially. I haven\'t gone down farther in the process so I will keep you posted. The number (for complaints) posted online is not the correct telephone number- for Las Vegas call 229-6444 (OPTION 2), for North Las Vegas call 633-1390, and Henderson call 267-4970.   \n\nTaken from www.accessclarkcounty.com\nNoisy animals are misdemeanor violations which if witnessed by an Animal Control Officer may result in the issuance of a citation and criminal prosecution of the owner. Should an Animal Control Officer issue a citation for a noisy animal the complainant\'s name will be listed on the citation as the affected party and you will be required to testify in court to the habitual nature of the noise. This is also why we suggest that you speak to these parties and try to work together as neighbors before filing a noisy animal complaint. We would suggest that you try to resolve this with your neighbors. It is only with your cooperation a case can go forward towards resolution.\n \nIf Animal Control is unable to witness the violation the complaint will be forwarded to the Neighborhood Justice Center for mediation. Should mediation fail to resolve the problem you will be provided with a District Attorney\'s packet. In most cases a letter is sent by the District Attorney\'s Office prior to filing a Criminal Complaint to bring this matter into court. This process also requires the corroboration of two neighbors to process the Criminal Complaint.', 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'XjfKBr96h6GgrfkR_q6gIA'}

I was able to hop on at a stop just a block or so away from my apartment.  The first leg took us to the South Strip transfer station where I got on a bus driven by a friendly young man "staight outta detroit" and a self-proclaimed "gangsta" but not in a creepy/scary way.  It was New Year\'s, the bus crowd was in a good mood and he made good use of the PA system, especially when we stopped at a red light next to a car that featured a couple having sex in the backseat.  Oh, Vegas.\n\nThe ride back: Not so great.  Had to walk a couple of miles just to reach a bus stop because of all the closures on the strip, which isn\'t the RTC\'s fault.  But once I got on a bus and reached the transfer station it was a bit of a fail.  We waited in the cold for a good 40 minutes for a bus to arrive.  People were worn out and just wanted to go home.  Would have been wise to have more buses on the ride during the busiest night of the year, but them\'s the breaks when you live in a city in financial dire straits.

There was a box to place a vote for you favorite piece of art you saw, so I participated. I think I was the first vote in the box.

If you thought the airline security lines are bad, this is 10 times worse.

I felt like I was going to meet the President or the Queen.   What is scary is that the line could have several hundred people waiting and they have only one security check point.    Here is my summary:\nGOOD POINTS: 4 stars\n1.  This is the classic million dollar view.....ooops wait this is 2007 and there has been inflation......This is the classic billion dollar view.  A small one bedroom apartment would go for over a million with a view like this.  Over 800 feet in the air.  I came right before sunset and saw Las Vegas in sunlight, sunset and night.   This is an indoor enclosed platform with floor to ceiling glass windows 360 degrees in a circle.  SPECTACULAR\n2.  Fast Elevators.   If you are slightly claustrophobic, this is ok if you can handle regular elevators.   They say the speed is about 25 MPH...which means going 800 feet straight up is less than a minute.\n3.  You can stay as long as you want and no one bugs you to keep moving on.   I was there for 2 hours just staring at the scenery.  Great place to sit and have a good conversation with someone or read a book during the slow season.   At sunset, the place was nearly empty.\n4  Daytime photography is great.   There is little distortion from the windows.\nBAD POINTS:  2 stars\n1.  The security check in is a LONG wait.   God knows how long it would be with 100 or more people in line during peak season.  Call ahead to check to see how long the lines are.\n2.  Night time photography is awful.   For safety reasons there is a double or more panes of glass between you and the elements.   As a result, you get multiple reflections through the layers of glass that is unavoidable.   I took long exposures when resting the camera on a steel beam...so i know there was very little movement.....and the pictures still were blurry with distortions consistent with camera position.\n3.  Admission is $10.95 including tax.   A little steep for Vegas and just sightseeing for an hour or so for most people.

As soon as I\'m within an hour or so of the Pittsburgh area, I tune in and catch every second of amazing programming that I can.  Imagine a public radio station in this day and age.  One that plays music from all decades (but mainly focuses on relatively recent releases) and not just classical music and the news.  There are NPR news updates every hour on the hour and some special talk radio programs here and there (including my very favorite radio show, the brilliant _This American Life_), but for the most part you get music, music, music.\n\nThe entire staff is really knowledgeable about what gets played.  Every CD gets listened to with care before the music director and his staff decide whether it\'ll get put into rotation.  No record companies or big businesses breathing down the deejays\' backs here, for a change.  The songs you here are of the highest caliber.  That doesn\'t necessarily mean I dig \'em all--sometimes I have to just sit back and take it in, thinking of WYEP 91.3 ("where the music matters!") as this amazing mix tape made by a friend.  Not every song is going to hit me just right the first time, but I have to realize that each and every tune was chosen with care and for many reasons.  That thought encourages me to stop my obnoxious habit of flipping the dial as soon as I don\'t feel a love relationship blossoming between me and the song that\'s just started.\n\nIf you don\'t live in Pittsburgh, worry not--you can listen to streaming audio at wyep.org!  I have done this many a time, I tell you.  \n\nIf you do live in Pittsburgh, the perks get even better.  Volunteer and you get to see the studio and their amazing collection of CDs.  Volunteer at a festival and see some of your favorite singers up close and personal for free!  There are volunteer appreciation shows, member appreciation shows, and of course plain old shows for the regular public (some free, some not).  There\'s always something going on, so be sure to check out the website.  I\'m rarely in town for the summer concert series, but a few years back I stood in the front row of a Wilco concert for free!  \n\nThanks, public radio and all of you out there who donate time and money.

I love being able to log into my account online from... wherever... and indulge my sudden whims by transferring a book, movie, CD, whatever piece of media, to my nearby branch and placed on loving hold in my name. My teen likes their anime selection; the little ones really like the little play area and huge selection of kids\' books. Plus, they do kids\' activities quite a bit. \n\nMy hubby has found really recent movie releases here, sometimes there is a wait. I think we got Order of the Phoenix about a week after the DVD came out. I was able to snag a copy of Arcade Fire\'s Neon Bible right when it came out, and was able to scoop up Augusten Burroughs galore shortly after Running with Scissors was released in theaters. (If you like neurotic dry humor, gotta check him out in nonfiction. I\'m hooked.) \n\nThere are a ton of computers to use (never actually used one though), and the librarians are really nice. Kinda slow at times, but really really nice... and helpful. For the crap they have to put up with sometimes, gotta admire them. \n\nAll in all, it\'s a weekly trip we all really enjoy. The atmosphere is decent, and the bathrooms are super clean. We can pretty much get what we want, and I don\'t feel like I\'ve been made to squeal like a pig, like I do when walking out of Barnes & Noble. Now if I could just get them to open a little coffee bar... :) \n\nMinus one star for needing a bigger parking lot during turista season (yeah, like that spring training parking ain\'t gonna end up there... it\'s right across from the stadium) and having a door alarm that likes my hubby way, way too much.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'jl67C8OhNXD5oMZ0v7RbUw'}

Among them is being within walking distance of two of Pittsburgh's four major parks--Schenley Park and Frick Park.  Schenley is where you go for statues, movies, and museums.  Frick Park is where you go for horticulture and nature.\n\nFrick park is absolutely enormous.  It stretches from Reynolds Street on the north to the Parkway on the south.  A connector trail will soon take you to the Monongahela River and the bike trail along side that.\nThere are extensive hiking trails throughout the park's steep valleys and wooded slopes.   I love to bike and there are several good bike trails throughout the park.  One word of caution--you must stick to the bike trails.  Not only is going off the trails unsafe, you could harm the ecological balance of the park by creating a new trail and adherence to the policy is strictly enforced.   \n\nWhat I really love about Frick Park is that it is practically the woods in the city.  Not only are the trails through woodlands, but horticulture and botany seem to be the main focus here.   The Park District has started a program to remove invasive trees and species from Frick Park.  Per the website, over the past 3 years, 325 Norway maples and 600 Trees of Heaven have been removed, allowing the out-competed natives in the understory to thrive. \n\nThis is truely a wonderous place to visit, any time of the year.  My favorite time is autumn.  I love to hike or bike in the cool crisp air with the palatte of colors surrounding me.  It is a place to come into and slow down for awhile.  Appreciate the nature.  And do me and yourself a favor.  Shut your !@# cel phone off when you come in here!  Be in the moment here.  Allow yourself to become immersed here!

Alors déjà je ne comprends même pas qu'on puisse abandonner un animal. Qu'on l'ait perdu, c'est une chose, mais l'abandonner?! Vive le consumérisme!\nDonc nous voulions un chat, un vieux chat car nous voulions donner une seconde chance à un abandonné. Deuxième critère, il devait être dégriffé car notre propriétaire était d'accord pour un animal mais à la condition qu'il n'abîme pas les boiseries de l'appartement. Or pour nous, pas question de faire subir ce genre d'opération à un pauvre animal! Donc il nous fallait un vieux chat, déjà dégriffé et avec lequel on ait un bon feeling... Autant dire que ce n'était pas gagné!\nArrivés à la SPCA, on nous dirige vers la section des chats. L'endroit est propre et suffisamment grand pour que plusieurs personnes à la fois puisse faire le tour des cages. Les cages elles, sont de taille moyenne, mais toutes sont très propres. Les chats jouent, somnolent, miaulent, regardent, bref jouent leur rôle de chat. Sous chaque cage il y a des étiquettes bilingues avec plusieurs mentions telles que le nom de l'animal, son âge, s'il est stérilisé ou non, dégriffé ou non et enfin s'il a des particularités (problèmes de santé, etc.). Très pratique donc pour s'y retrouver! En plus des bénévoles passent régulièrement. Ils connaissent très bien les animaux, leurs petites habitudes, leur caractère et répondent très gentiment à toutes nos questions.\nBien sûr nous, nous tombons amoureux d'un chat tout en griffes. Bien que ça ne corresponde pas à nos critères, nous demandons tout de même à le voir. Un des bénévole nous enferme alors dans une salle avec le matou en question et nous laisse le temps que l'on veut pour voir si ça marche entre nous ou pas. Dix minutes plus tard, Wilson le chat, ronronne en se frottant sur nos jambes.  Évidemment nous n'en tombons que plus amoureux! Mais toujours hors de question de le dé-griffer. Mince alors, Houston, on a un problème! On expose notre cas au bénévole de tout à l'heure qui nous explique alors que la SPCA est elle aussi opposée au dégriffage et qu'elle propose une alternative qui sont les caps pour griffes. Les quoi?! Les caps. Des petites coques en plastique qui ont la forme des griffes et qui existent en plusieurs tailles et couleurs. On les colle directement sur les griffes (ce qui n'est vraiment pas compliqué à faire!) et hop, on est tranquille pour quelques mois. Il faut les remettre ainsi régulièrement, mais honnêtement ce n'est pas une grosse contrainte. Et surtout ça nous a permis de pouvoir adopter Wilson le chat! Merci la SPCA pour le conseil!\nPour la suite des opérations, les bénévoles ont continué de se montrer tout aussi efficaces, agréables et compétents que tout au long de notre visite. Ils nous ont longuement expliqué quel avait été la parcours de l'animal, son état de santé, ses besoins, les dépenses auxquelles nous devions nous attendre et aussi les choses à faire et celles à éviter. Enfin, comme nous n'avions pas de cage pour lui, ils nous ont fourni un carton de transport et voilà : emballé c'est pesé!

The guys were great and made the experience a lot of fun.  \n\nIt took two hours each way to get there and back on the bus from my Las Vegas Strip hotel but it was definitely worth it.

What started as a one toy purchase turned into fifteen and I swear, I had more fun buying them then the kids who will soon receive them.\n\nThis place gets a little bonus love from me because the lovely lady behind the till threw in some soap and lotions (for Moms!) free of charge to pay it forward to the folks in Edinburgh.\n\nI am the Evil Auntie to two little ones back home, so I dare say i\'ll be popping back here again to find them unique toys and nerdy giftables, even if it\'ll cost me a bomb to get them back across the point. But if you have local little ones (or ones on the way!), you should definitely poke your head in here. The prices might be a bit higher then your big box options but the cool factor is worth the price tag.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'JySNI9tIhmFFtUorc4zkwg'}

Eye contact: not recommended. \n\nI waited here 3 hours. Yes 3 hours because Davey and John Paul punched each others lights out, or Chantelle was so drunk she fell on some glass. There was more police here than doctors, that gives an indication of the type of people and behaviour that go on in this A & E department. It is very sad and gives a true indication of this country.

They make you feel at ease and use the very latest in local anaesthesia. \n\nAs the program I am in has not fully finished yet I cannot comment on the full outcome but I will review the part up to today. \n\nAs I said they try to make you at ease, until you have to get a full treatment and boy did I have some treatment! \nI will give a small overview of what I had so far in the last 4 years\nRoot Canals (about 5 or 6)\nNerve Cuts\nGum Slices\nRemoval of old fillings -  all of them\nHoling and roughing molars\nCleansing gums, teeth and jaw.\nVeneers on the Front row\nCaps on the bottom front row\nBridges to support the veneers\nCement for caps and molars hoods\nGold fittings on all molars \n...\nand many many many needles in my palate, gum and jaw to numb for treatment. \n\nOnly on some occasions it really hurt, (mostly the needles) but hey they are dentists in training and always under supervision of a consultant!\n\nAnyone who has been to the dentist and had a filling or a root-canal treatment will know what it is like - I have had this nearly every 2-3 months. - Thinking about it does make my claw clench up. \n\nThe biggest drawback regarding this 'stretched treatment' \n\nThey will not give you a guarantee but if anything is amiss you can always call upon them to fix it. - if it is beyond your own dentist's skill or knowledge. \n\nI had my problems, but they weren't anything too major. - Just badly timed. I lost a molar fitting while holidaying in Finland, I cracked my Front Veneers 2x just when the weekend started and the latest was a cemented metal bridge that gave way on Boxing Day... whoopsie.. \n\nBut I was able to make an emergency appointment the day after and all was good again. \n\nIf you (like me) struggled with really bad set of teeth, ground up and anxiety induced acid erosion and possibly facing a bill nearing the £30k. Try asking your dentist if it would be possible to become a subject at the Dental Institute.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'tZs84cKAUSOtP_nAiSdreQ'}

Everybody knows Edinburgh is all about the castle, the festival, the dungeons and the zoo, with its infamous Penguin Parade! \n\nOne of my favorite attractions at the zoo is Budongo Trail which is where they keep the chimps. It is a huge outdoor and indoor enclosure with lots of ropes and wooden platforms for the chimps to play on in the outdoors section and a viewing gallery indoors where there is only a sheet of glass between you and these gorgeous creatures. Unfortunately they had to close the reptile enclosure to make way for Budongo Trail which is a shame as it was a hit with the kids, but hey everybody loves chimps' right?\n\nAnother winner is Rainbow Landing where you can buy some nectar to feed the beautiful rainbow lorikeets which happily come and perch on you as long as you have a cup of the sweet stuff! \n\nThe Animal Antics show is always good fun and has been different every time I've seen it. It mostly consists of birds of prey doing some cool stuff and the presenters always pick a few kids from the audience to help out. \n\nOne of the first enclosures you come across at the zoo is the sea lions. There is a sea lion show on at various times throughout the day but even if you can't make this the sea lions are always entertaining to watch as they are so playful.\n\nThe Hilltop Safari is a great way to see the zoo and is particularly good for anyone with mobility issues as the zoo is on a huge slope which is really steep in parts. In the Hilltop Safari you climb aboard what looks like a milk float being pulled by a jeep and the driver gives a running commentary of the animals you pass and tells you lots of interesting tit bits about them. \n\nIf you get peckish you can visit the The Bistro in New Mansion for some fancy smancy food or alternatively you could dine in the Mansion House Bar which is more a sort of soup and sandwiches affair or you could go for the afternoon tea for two for £16! However if you have your little toe rags with you then your best bet is the Jungle Café where there is a soft play area and the food is more school canteen style with pizzas and baked potatoes. \n\nLast but most definitely not least is the Penguin Parade! As you would learn if you went to the parade it has been taking place at the zoo every day since 1951 when a keeper accidently left the enclosure door open and the penguins went for a little walk around but then just went back in the enclosure! The zoo has the largest penguin pool in the world and you could literally spend a good hour watching these little guys. \n\nFinally Edinburgh Zoo is open every single day of the year, even Christmas Day so you have no excuse not to visit!", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'N3K9wuyFN0rMV8-F9_ZjFg'}

Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). \n\nSo, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early.

I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: \n\n1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html \n\n2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. \n\n3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. \n\n4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. \n\n5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. \n\nOh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. \n\nOh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship). \n \nLe sigh... \n\nOpen T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm", 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw'}

The sight lines from our lawn seats were pretty good and they have a decent amount of seating in several different lawn sections.  The complex is large, with multiple practice fields, manicured lawns, walkways and waterways.  The replica stadium fields are a nice touch.  \n\nThere were some aspects of my experience here that really detracted from the day.  First of all, the parking situation is ridiculous.  One would imagine that having a large open space to build this complex would allow for a better design for the parking lot but its just a huge mess.  Also, the parking lot is really far from the stadium itself, you have to cross the entire complex to get there.\n\nThe concessions also left much to be desired, it was pretty much your standard stadium fare.  The service at the concession stands really needs work.  It wasn\'t that they didn\'t have enough people, they were certainly well staffed, but they really need to figure out a system to speed up the process.  I\'m sure it will come with time.  Also, my hot dog was pretty lackluster and my hot pretzel was as hard as a rock.  If you have ever been to a game with me you know that I love stadium food.  LOVE IT.

It may not seem safe but I have never seen any broken glass and my car is always un-touched.  It is worth the risk because the parking lot off 51st Ave is a nightmare.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers play in Maryvale and their fan-friendly attitude extends here in Maryvale.  The practice fields are all open for the public to mingle with the players.  The players must walk through the parking lot, past the front gate, to get to the clubhouse.  This gives fans an up close and personal experience that they would never find at a Major League facility.  \n\nThe seating in Maryvale is also the best in the Cactus League.  The entire seating bowl is below street level and is covered with canopies.  The third base line is shaded for almost the entire game and most of the first base side is too.  The grass seats extend down the lines and wraps around the outfield.  All of the seats are close and most have decent spacing.\n\nThe food selection is great.  Not only do they offer each of the sausages featured in the Sausage Race (Hot Dog, Polish, Brat, Italian, Chorizo) but they also have sauerkraut.  They are the ONLY stadium that has sauerkraut.  There are also independent food vendors.  Make sure you try the kettle korn (free samples are always offered) because it is the best in the Cactus League.  There is usually a BBQ place and a Yakisoba Noodle stand that cannot be beat.  Beers are primarily Miller brand but they do have a handful of imports.\n\nThe fan friendly experience is what makes this park stand out.  Tshirts and other giveaways are usually tossed to fans from the first base dugout every couple of innings.  The Sausage Race always takes place during the top of the 7th.  They sing Roll Out The Barrel after Take Me Out To The Ballgame.  Even Bob Uecker makes the trip and sits in the booth calling the game.  \n\nMaryvale is surely a stadium that could turn you into a Brewers fan and could make anyone a baseball fan.  Once you are inside, you forget that you are in Maryvale.  Take a chance on this place and you will not be sorry.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'fev0iI-XDrteD4SYRKjiUw'}

It's quite a trek for me from Mesa, but I like baseball and am always game to visit a new ballpark. \n\nWhen approaching the stadium, all the workers were very nice. Walked up to the window and purchased a grass seat. Entered the park. Not what I was expecting for a brand new park. Nice, but pretty basic. But really, I there for the game and not the park. \n\nThe grass area is a little bit steeper than what I'm used to. Also the area to the left of center field isn't designed that well. You have to sit pretty far back to be able to see over the wall. All in all a good experience as long as you don't sit really close to center field. The biggest complaint is you cannot see the score board, at all. So you have no clue what the score is, what inning it is, anything. And there are no other smaller boards around the park for this info. \n\nLet's move on to the food. I ended up ordering from the pizza stand on the right field side. Lines weren't that long, but they did take a good amount of time. From the time I ordered my food (chicken strip basket) to when I got my food, it took more than 10 minutes. Food was nice and hot and pretty tasty. Not bad for $7. My friend just ordered fries and hers took just as long. \n\nOn the way back to our seats we stopped at one of the carts in the left field side to get margaritas. I was not happy to find out they only take cash, despite the electronic cash register they had. I'm always disappointed this day and age when people can't take debit. Oh well, their loss. I guess I didn't really need alcohol :( \n\nLater in the game we went to sit in regular seats. About half-way between third base and the outfield wall. GREAT seats. Very roomy and comfortable. Very good view of the field. \n\nAll in all, a great day at the ballpark! Not one of my faves in the valley. If it was closer, I'd go again. But I doubt I'll trek out that far again.", 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'fGi3Kg1FRFurq_2JBfw_Gw'}

I am now looking it as a good thing after visiting a few care facilities.  There have been a few wonderful places we interviewed and now we have found the one that we feel is the perfect place for our Mom. I no longer look at it as a bad thing.  Our Mother has Alzheimer\'s and I can see her such a quick decline.  I feel that The Stratford is really going to help her flourish.  It is the most beautiful place I\'ve seen and it really feels like a grand hotel.  The staff have been wonderful and really enjoy the residents.  The Stratford has a program called "Passages".  This is elective and can be a half day or full day and seven days a week.  The cost is very minimal and the ladies hang out together as a group all day.  They play wonderful games to help with memory. They went on a field trip to see the Christmas lights.  They do all kinds of things together.  There are several size rooms and we chose a studio because she is going to be so busy all day that it\'s just like a hotel. You\'re only in your room to sleep.  My Mom will be bringing her little dog and we will use their service to make sure the dog is taken out for potty breaks.\nThe meals are amazing.  They have the food on display so the residents can see what the specials are for the day.   Other amenities are the "Soda Shop" where your family can get together for parties.  You may bring your own food or have them cater.  It\'s really cool because it\'s all done it 50\'s style retro.  There is a wonderful theatre called the "Rhett and Scarlett" theatre.  They show movies twice a day and they have actual theatre style seating.  You will also find a craft/cooking room, Chapel, Beauty Shop, numerous seating areas. \nI just can\'t say enough about "The Stratford".  The only minus was there are not enough pictures on their website to give you the true picture of the residence.  Being the photographer that I am I thought I would go in and take pictures so that I could share them with out of state family so they can be rest assured Mom will be well taken care of.  I know "The Stratford" is the place I would like to be when my time comes.  I\'m not looking at it as a sad thing.  Mom is going to love the residents and her suite.  We are going to bring in some of her favorite furniture so that she feels right at home.  \nI hope this helps others out there that are faced with such a difficult decision.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': '6cqaHBhtZvUuFzb00InbeQ'}

Here\'s where you have to go to get a copy of your Marriage Certificate for name changes and all that the experience entails. Most of you will get it over the Internet but I went in person. \n\nWhile looking at the directory outside an employee taking a smoke break asked me if I needed some help finding where I needed to go. How\'s that for service and a random act of kindness so rarely found in Sin City? God Bless the smokers! Always have the low down on work place gossip and general Will Rogers type anecdotes in my experience. I was relieved despite my Rain Man recall of song lyrics, directions and general culture maven status because it could be either of two places on two different floors to check out and time was of the essence. My pal the Marlboro Man hooked me up! "Walk down the long hall to the elevator bank (which have the same animals painted on the freeways and Access Clark County logo) and go up to the 2nd floor. You need the Recorder\'s Office. It\'s late in the day so you may have to come back tomorrow but good luck little lady." I thanked him and bid him farewell. Shockingly, it\'s rare that someone here will offer anything unless it involves your cash going into their pocket. I guess I\'m just used to southern hospitality. When I ask someone in Texas a question, it usually turns into a half hour conversation I have to break away from. I\'m not complaining, I like to gab but my sister hates it. She usually asks where I know the person from and then gets irritated when I tell her they were a stranger. Stranger danger is hardwired in her DNA. Anywho it play out as follows:\n\nI wasn\'t discouraged I went in at 4:30 p.m. and literally the only people there were employees. My past experience in other cities has lead me to conclude that city and county employees and all civil servants for that matter are notorious clock watchers and efficiency speeds up dramatically after 4 p.m. Beautiful building. I was surprised it was this nice and wondered who performs the drudgery of vacuuming. They employ a plethora of signs and I yearned for the signage contract calculating the contract and terms in my head. I followed the signs and found my way into the labyrinth that lead to the belly of the beast. \n\nMy quest ended in the Recorders Office. They gave me a number, 434 and told me to walk to the end and wait until they called my number. Two people ahead of me at 4:34 p.m. and they were already enthralled in conversation. Ten LONG minutes later they had 433 on their flashing sign. I informed them there was no 433 and I was the last person who gained entry. This fell on deaf ears followed by smirks and rolling of the eyes as it was now about 4:39 p.m. Two more long minutes later my number flashes but they still wait to call me. I\'m being punished for my emotional outburst! They have pictures up of famous couples who married in Las Vegas, Elvis and Cilla, Steve and Edye Gourme, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Mai. I ask if Sammy Davis was the first interracial couple married here. Nobody knows or cares since it\'s almost 5 p.m. My inquiring mind tortures me as usual and I must do my own research.\n\nThey remark on my husband\'s unusual first name and print me out a marriage certificate which looks like something I could print out on my home computer. I was expecting something with the Las Vegas sign or a showgirl or something creative in the watermark. (P.S. there is no watermark). \n\nNote: You need to bring your check book because they levy a 3.5% charge for using a debit or credit card!  The certificate is $15.00! Other cities only charge $1.00 for a certified copy-believe me I checked. I\'m used to feeling violated here. They should at least give me a coupon for dinner and a movie or a free counseling session after pounding my ass this hard. \n\nOn the whole, this was an interesting experience and while the employees were unfazed and nonchalant they weren\'t openly hostile as are employees in dental and doctor\'s offices here. They just weren\'t willing to make small talk or humor/entertain me which I think is an enormous part of customer service=basic human kindness. Funny how they are trying to train people to pretend to care at places like Sitel. That should surprise no one who has to call any call center. Many of the employees are missing the sensitivity chip. \n\nHands down the best thing about doing any kind of drudgery like this or DMV is that this is a small town and I can breeze in and out of any of these places in less than an hour. This would take a day and a half in any large city in Texas. \n\nSatisfactory on my Vegas scale but you can do better people. This is the mecca of the minimum effort mentality.', 'stars': 3, 'user_id': 'pmz03Nr4ellKhbodbSgNeg'}

My trip today took 37 minutes waiting in line...\n\nThe building is small and unnoticeable unless you are looking for it - then they have weird hours, especially the 2 hour Saturday operation. Here\'s a quick clue- if you can find a parking spot, they are closed. I showed up today at 11:30 and rejoiced at the ability to find a parking spot. See above...they were closed. I left and ran some errands in the area, returning at 12:10 - just 10 minutes past opening. As I walked in the door, I noted the lobby was full and it wrapped down the hall way and turned down another hall. Really? That many people in just a few minutes? Of course there were only 2 workers, so that helped the delay. While continuing with negative thoughts in my mind and watching the unsupervised children running around, screaming and playing with the PO Boxes while the mom didn\'t care. My only source of amusement while waiting in a line of more than 50 people was the number of people who came in after me. I counted 5 who walked in, looked around and said "Jesus!"...others looked forward to the October day when the new post office opens. \n\nBesides the operation hours, the constant line of people regardless of the time and the horrible parking situation is the limited supplies. If they are closed, you would think there would be a nice stash of labels, envelopes and forms in the outside lobby so that customers could complete their mailing ahead of time. That would speed up the line. No. The only thing in the lobby was a stack of fliers promoting the upcoming appearance of Phil Vasser at the performing arts center. That was the reason I had an errand to run - I needed to buy an envelope so I could complete the mailing. Otherwise there is a tricky traffic jam between the people holding the door open, then releasing to let people out, only to grab it again...and the people coming in needing supplies. They walk inside to locate the envelope and labels while the rest of the lobby stares them down to make sure they do not cut in front of the massive line.\n\nCombine this with the mail delivery that sucks - wrong address, inconsistent times - just general suck-ass-iness...\n\nThis place and its service just plain sucks.

Only the bigger coasters and certain carnival-type rides are open, but honestly that's all you really need in the ride department (I'm satisfied with just riding the Intimidator).  The whole place is transformed into a Halloween themed park with creepy music playing and fog rolling through the walkways.  They also have plenty of scary costumed people wandering around the park just waiting to scare the crap out of you!  Don't worry though, they usually tend to prey on the groups of pre-teen/teenagers.  There are several haunted houses set up throughout the park, all with different themes and most of them are really good.  And of course one or two of the haunted houses will have the obligatory scary dude chasing you out the door with a fake chainsaw.  The park gets pretty crowded so it's not a bad idea to arrive a little early.  Getting out of the parking lot at the end of the night can be horrendous so it's not a bad idea to leave early too.  You might even want to watch for the sneak route out of the parking lot on your way in because it's been useful when the line of cars leaving the parking lot is backed up for over an hour.

For a business, a lack of communication can create many issues including alienating your customer base. Government agencies are unique in that when we do not receive adequate service we cannot simply go to a competitor. The Department of Revenue exemplifies poor communication resulting in poor customer service. \n\nOn a positive note, the list of individuals I spoke with today were friendly and able to each provide some type of information that helped the mysterious puzzle begin to take shape; however, several calls and valuable work time could have been avoided if clear communication were to take place. It is the old adage of one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing. \n\nOver the weekend I received a letter labeled "accounts receivable demand notice" - sounds scary, but more interesting was the fact that I have never received prior communication indicating anything was afoot. There was no explanation, no contact person - only a summarized account balance showing penalties and interest for some unknown event occurring four years ago. \n\nThe first lead was the bolden invitation to visit them on the web, to which the corresponding web site address was unable to provide an further information. On the back of the statement read the message "if you do not agree with the balance or need further explanation, please call..". I called the number and spoke with a lady asking for the agent\'s name and other information I did not have. No worries - I provided my taxpayer ID and she was able to provide the agent\'s name and phone number. She said she would connect me, but for my information the agent\'s number was...and as she gave the number she mumbled the last 2 digits. I said excuse me, but I didn\'t get...too late - I was patched through to the agent\'s voice mail. The message stated I needed to leave a string of information including my UTI number. I don\'t know what that is, but I don\'t think I have it on this form... Still being friendly as not to upset "the man" I provided my name and contact information then indicated I had not received a prior letter nor did I have a UTI number, but I did have my taxpayer ID. I clearly stated that I also did not receive the full phone number and requested a return call. Within a few minutes my phone silently vibrated without catching my attention. The agent left a voice mail stating my call was being returned and to please call back. The agent did not leave the office number and the caller ID showed Blocked. Again, I had to return to the general office number and work back to the agent. \n\nWhen I finally reached the agent, I received information as to what generated the letter, what was needed and why it occurred. The agent stated I should next call the collections number or I could set up something on the department web site. But even if I did the web site, I should cal the number to prevent them from taking it further. I chose phone call. In calling the collections department the person answering the phone asked the same questions and suggested I contact the agent. When I indicated that I had already spoken to the agent and it was suggested I phone collections, the representative was puzzled why the agent would send me to them. I was told that the issue was coded to auditing and should contact them to really get it resolved, but since auditing told me to call collections, maybe they could set it up on their end. My information was taken including name, address, SSN, employer, bank, etc. I indicating I would pay half of the bill this month and the other half next month. I asked if I would be sent a bill. I was told probably not - but I could phone in each time and pay over the phone. \n\nWhile each person was friendly and had at least a piece of the puzzle (which is the reason for the second star), the entire ordeal took longer than an hour and would have continued to run in loops. The agent suggesting I contact the collections department to avoid further issues and collections suggesting I contact the agent to prevent further issues shows how well they have the run around game down to a science. Maybe it would be too easy for one person to field the call, give an explanation and take the steps to resolve the issue. Oh, you want to pay? Let me set that up for you. Thanks!

Painting-sized weavings hung or draped, attributed to a variety of modernists (Miro, Picasso, etc). I'd never seen this style of art in a permanent collection before, amidst large, more conventional paintings, and was fascinated. I don't know how I feel about them hanging side-by-side with other flat works - they appeal more to the craft side of my brain and require a different reading. But still, awesome.\n\nFor 8 bucks and discounted parking, this is a rad way to spend a few hours. The store's a little tiny but there's some interesting wares, jewelry, MoMA design objects.

It\'s got at least 2 dozen +/-24" HP TouchSmart Screens and all of the top accompaniments.  There\'s even spa-like music playing in the background.  What is this place really?  \n\nWay up in N. Scottsdale I was up here in the area and thought I\'d quickly stop by to check out the place.  Read about the recent opening and must applaud the efforts on making it a green friendly facility. Considering the budget woes and pathetic quality of public education thought it was ironic that Scottsdale opened another library. \n\nScottsdale is applying to have the Appaloosa Library certified at the gold level in the U.S. Green Building Council\'s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program.\n\nThe 21,000-square-foot space is very contemporary; features natural lighting and a 600-square-foot array of photovoltaic panels that provide 2.5 percent of the building\'s peak energy demand. A monitor allows visitors to see how much energy from the sun is being generated for the library\n\nAlso, the library has a floating floor in the main room that makes it easier to reroute cabling to readapt the space and move bookshelves around.  Even the shelves feature energy-efficient LED lighting.\n\nWith the exception of the children\'s area a lot of the shelves look kinda empty (guessing not from checked out books). Not a far-out assumption considering the demographics and its average literacy-level.  \n\nOff to see if I can book a foot massage with the help desk...', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'r-t7IiTSD0QZdt8lOUCqeQ'}

While not nearly as extensive as the Champlin museum used to be, it does have one important and very cool draw... the "Sentimental Journey", a restored WWII era B-17.  \n\nWhat makes this B-17 special is that they allow you to get a taste of what it was like to be a WWII airmen by climbing through the hatch and crawling through the very cramped interior of the aircraft!  It is an eye opening experience to get a taste of how brave these men used to be as they loaded up for each bombing raid, knowing they would be traveling in those small, cold, and dangerous conditions.\n\nThe remainder of the museum contains about a dozen other aircraft primarily from the WWII era with a couple of Cold War jets (F-4 and MiG-21) thrown in for fun.  There are a few very interesting stories and biographies covering local Mesa WWII heroes on the walls and a few fun exhibits covering the Women Air Service Pilots (WASP\'s), Doolittle Raiders, and the Tuskegee Airmen.  Otherwise, this is one of the smaller aircraft museums I\'ve been to.  It will take you about two hours to see it all, although there were several volunteers working who probably have a story or two to add about each exhibit.\n\nHighlight: Walking across the 6 inch wide catwalk inside the "Sentimental Journey" with the bomb-bay doors open.

She would get infected patches, and my dad would clean her wounds.  None of the nurses did anything but flirt with the doctors.\n\nTo top THAT off, the head nurse pulled my mother aside during these awful times, and told her that she should not have consented to put in a trach -- that it was a waste of time, she'd never recover, so this was just unnecessary suffering -- that we should  euthanate her instead with a morphine drip.  Yes, she pushed us to consent to morphine overdose. She made my mother cry, and guilt-trip for months over her decision to place the trach.  \n\nMy grandmother recovered in a rehab center months later, and lived over a year before dying at age 94 in her sleep.\n\nI'm very disgusted by the way they handled the whole situation.", 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'Pvda-p1TtoxAkeXg5MIB6w'}

We\'ve seen larger collections of Chihuly\'s work and installations in more amazing settings, as in the Desert Botanical Garden in AZ a couple of years ago and, of course, the ceiliing of the Bellagio lobby. But the display here seemed unique for how "up close" one could get to the art.  \n\nNow if we could only afford to buy one of the talented Mr.Chihuly\'s creations!

They also host wonderful events including swing fore kids golf classic. \n\nA few years back I attend an event with my brother and my mom. It was called swing fore kids golf classic. It was a lot of fun seeing all the children including my brother playing golf with the pros. My brother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and was unable to do a lot of things growing up participated in this event because it is for children with cancer. I feel that this event is a wonderful idea. The kids get to finally go out and enjoy themselves. As well as all the donations that they receive go to a worthy cause. This event is very \nimportant in my point of view to help the family's as well as the children overcome a lot of different things and get to do something fun. This event is hosted by the phoenix children's hospital. And sponsored by pet smart and southwest section of PGA \n. \nWhen it comes to this event it is not only for the kids enjoyment but also for the donations. All the donations made to this event go to the animal therapy program which helps the kids overcome the fear of their chemo, or just makes the child happy and understanding of all the pricks and pokes to help them. Therefore if you are not a golfer there is an at least 50 dollar donation fee but it includes lunch, admission \nto the silent auction as well as part of the raffle. Or if you would like to just make a donation you can go to this website http://www.cbre.com/USA/US/AZ/Phoenix/Misc/swingforekidsgolfclassic.htm?pageid=0 and fill out a donation form and send it in. They do not have a set donation goal at this time. \nWhen it comes to the kids at this event. I think it is a wonderful thing to see these kids out and about finally being able to have some fun for once. When it comes to a normal child who is healthy and isn't spending most their life in and out of hospitals they are able to do what normal kids do aka go to school, go outside and play in the yard as well as if their parents wanna take them mini golfing they can. As for children with cancer they have weakened immune systems which prevent them from being able to do a lot of things normal children do. Therefore the swing fore kids golf classic is a chance for these kids to go out and enjoy the weather as well as themselves. At the end of the classic as well is a 50,000 hole in one grand prize which can help pay for medical expenses even just something fun for the child themselves to enjoy. \nTherefore by my perspective I feel that swing fore kids golf classic event is a wonderful opportunity for children of all ages with cancer to go out and have a fun time playing golf with the pros. And with all the donations they are receiving while the children are having a blast they will be able to keep the animal therapy program at large to help the kids when there back in the hospital.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'CfYyjvUioUmUBsm93WsK6g'}

I was told the procedure would take about one hour and I was asked to not take any aspirin (blood thinner) for at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. My appointment was scheduled for 12:30 and my check-in time was noon. \n\nI\'ve never been to this hospital before, so I double checked my directions online before I left the office. Well, the campus map is NOT accurate. Outpatient Radiology is located in a whole different area. And, the directional signs for the parking lot were lousy. The signage inside the hospital is even worse. I wasted about 20 minutes wandering before a lab tech was nice enough to walk me all the way over to where I needed to be on the OTHER side of the campus. \n\nWhen I did check in, I was told the procedure costs $2,000 and "was I prepared to pay that now?" Uh NO! Their computer system said someone attempted to contact me about their pre-payment policy but was unable to reach me due to an incorrect phone number. The admin person verified the number with me and it was correct. So since it appeared to be a mistake on their part, they let me just do a 10% deposit. Whatev. The pain was now moving from my hip to my pocketbook.\n\nI also learned at check-in that my doctor had ordered some blood work, which usually took about 45 minutes to get the report. WTF? They got me in for the blood work pretty quickly but then I sat in the lobby for more than an hour. \n\nEventually, I got back to the procedure room - two hours after my scheduled appointment time - and saw the doctor. He and the two technicians were very thorough. If I could review them separately, I would likely give them 4-5 stars. My injection went fine even though they had to do it without iodine because no one had relayed to them that I\'m mildly allergic to shellfish. I do feel I received quality health care, and I realize that is the most important thing (or at least I\'ve been trying to tell myself that). \n\nBTW, I tried to use their shuttle to get back to where my car was parked. The little bastard did a U-turn right in front of me and kept on going. So I got to walk about 1/2 mile back with a very odd feeling in my hip from the injection. \n\nAnd, I got back to the office at 4. Grrrrrrr.\n\nIf I\'m referred to that facility in the future I will most definitely ask if there are other options.', 'stars': 2, 'user_id': 'bkPFUCENKOYFDit-eV2PSw'}

The system runs on its own dedicated right-of-way in downtown, while on the strip it shares the road with other vehicles. Because of this, the vehicles are bound to get bogged down on Las Vegas Blvd. when the Strip becomes a proverbial parking lot. \n\nWith high frequency, relatively high speeds, and well marked, well lit stations, the ACE Gold Line is a welcomed mass transit option for Las Vegas!', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'QWYdmiFRyg0xtokomi6Q9A'}

It's tucked away in a little square just behind the imposing Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh building, where you buy your tickets from the main reception. There are always new exhibits coming and going, but on top of that there are 5 resident sections:\n\nThe History of Dentistry is your first stop, with life-sized models and recreations of early 19th-Century dental surgeries, and fantastically preserved original tools of this torturous trade. Then you pass along to the History of Surgery, again with enough gory models and early drawings/diagrams to keep kids (or me!) entertained, whilst there is also plenty for the more science-minded to have a read of. \n\nUpstairs there's an exhibition of Sport, Surgery and Physical Wellbeing - this is definitely the more modern section of the museum, and anyone with an interest in sports or physio will no doubt find this bit fascinating.\n\nBut my two favourite sections are the Burke and Hare exhibit and the History of Pathology. I thought I knew the infamous Burke and Hare story until I went along and had a read of the various sources and exhibits unavailable in other museums. If you're a tourist wanting to learn more about Edinburgh's famous history then this bit will definitely appeal to you.\n\nBut they save the best until last: the History of Pathology. I have to be honest, it's not for those of you with weak stomachs, but as long as you're not on your way somewhere for lunch immediately afterwards I can't recommend this section highly enough. There is every kind of body part imaginable, infected with every single disease you could think of, pickled and preserved disturbingly well in jars of all shapes and sizes.

At 25 acres, it is second in size only to Waterloo, and, with over 14.5 million passengers a year, the fifth busiest outside London.\n\n\n The first station on the site was that of the North British Railway, in 1846. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened Edinburgh General station on an adjacent site the same year, and in 1847 the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway opened a station to the north, but at a right angle at Canal Street. Waverley Station was formed by the union of the first two stations in 1854, and was completely rebuilt between 1892 and 1900. Canal Street closed in the 1860s.\n\n\n Sitting in a prime position in a cutting between the old and new towns of Edinburgh, its main feature is its huge glass ridge and furrow roof, which is 375ft wide and 1240ft long and was designed by engineers, Blyth and Westland and completed in 1900.\n\n\n Although it doesn't have a facade as such, the ticket hall, with its circular dome is its defining interior feature. Alas, the effect is currently somewhat spoiled by the insertion of a Costa Coffee pagoda underneath the dome, and the incursion of tables for cafes in the space itself: as well as detracting from the architecture, it makes circulation less easy. Still, any traveller should make the effort to take a look.\n\n\n On the New Town side, the bulk of the 5-star North British Hotel defines the entrance to the station - designed by the architects Hamilton and George Beattie and completed in 1902, it is a familiar sight to travellers to the capital. The design is essentially classical, with pedimented windows on all sides, with Jacobean detailing in the form of gable-level turrets. The principal feature is its bulky clock tower (said to be set two minutes fast to help people catch their trains), which is a landmark at this end of Princes Street. It is now owned by the Forte Group.\n\n\n The station has 20 platforms, although some of these are formed by splitting one platforms face into two by means of crossovers half way along. The essential design is of one very large island platform, with some additional through roads and a series of bays at the Glasgow end.\n\n\n The station has all the facilities you'd expect for one of its size. Accessibility remains a problems, however: only the Waverley Bridge (North and South) entrances have step-free access, although the ramps are long and quite steep. Some platforms can currently be reached only by stair climber (although they will replatform some trains if they know a wheelchair user wishes to board or alight).\n\n\n Travellers needing assistance, and wheelchair users in particular, should therefore contact their rail company before travelling. Dedicated staff are available for helping passengers with disabilities. Network Rail has a refurbishment programme under way to improve access.\n\n\n Services run to almost every part of Scotland except the West Coast lines, and there are through trains to most major cities in England (there are none direct to Wales). There is a 15 minute interval service to Glasgow Queen Street, and hourly or half hourly trains to London King's Cross.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'bESMAvMoKofbCsjE8m3uUg'}

There are around 20 different exhibitions put on here each year, ranging from the beautiful to the bizarre. This space can be rented very cheaply and is a good option for those just starting out in the art world. In addition to exhibitions, workshops are run to encourage and develop creativity in both budding and experienced artists. \n\nOnce a year, the artists open the doors to their studios to allow members of the public a glimpse into their working space.

I feel very strongly about this museum and want it to do well which is why, for the first time in the year I have been a member of Yelp, I am choosing to write a review. \n\nBefore I get started, just a little bit of info about the museum. The museum is tucked away in a corner of the Emergency Arts Collective in Las Vegas. If you go through the front door of the collective, it is immediately on your left. Looks can be deceiving as it is right next to a restaurant/bar and you wont see it until you walk through the front doors. \n\nNow for a little Burlesque 101. This is not the striptease you know that is so prevalent and popular in Las Vegas entertainment. Burlesque/Striptease is considered an art form. If you walk into a majority of the stripclubs in Las Vegas, you will find strippers, not dancers performing striptease. This is nothing against strippers. Striptease artist tend to spend more time on costume, music and performance than they do gyrating to the music. The goal of the dance is different between strippers and striptease artists. It seems like a semantical argument but its important. If you go to the museum expecting to find exhibits on the type of stripping you find in clubs and bars, you will be disappointed. \n\nNow onto the review. The museum is very small. About the size of a nice hotel room. But boy do they use the space! The walls are COVERED with photos and artifacts. The museum suffers from too much material and not enough space. Right now, the walls are covered with photos and archives of the Ms. Exotic World Competition they host every year. I spoke to the woman and she said that in May they would have a more historical exhibit up dealing with the history of striptease. Also, if you\'re lucky enough, you may find the legendary Dixie Evans in the museum and ready to chat you up. Dixie took over the museum and moved it Las Vegas. \n\nThe reason for the immense amount of material is that the woman who started the museum in its earliest incarnation was a legendary striptease artist named Jennie Lee. "The Bazoom Girl" as she was known, started the museum in Helendale, CA, but it was later moved to Las Vegas because Helendale was a little out of the way for most travelers. While the Helendale museum had about 40 acres, the museum now, as I mentioned, is very small. Jennie Lee, btw, was legendary in the burlesque world and I hope that the future exhibits show just how awesome she was. If you wanna know more about her, feel free to ask the people who are running the museum. They are very knowledgeable. \n\nWhich is where this review comes in. If you\'re a Burlesque fan and you wanna help, go visit the museum and donate! The museum is FREE. If not, ask more information about the Exotic World Competition and how to watch/join it. Buy some postcards, buy a t-shirt, do whatever you can to support this organization and get it the space it needs to expand.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'ZPb-r8rjm5PEFzwdxaezFw'}

I thought this was going to be a quick procedure with no major flaws.\n\nBut once I got up to the counter, the woman who was waiting on me (a middle-aged red-haired woman) was extremely pretentious and rude, and contradicted information explicitly stated on the DMV web site. The site said you needed a state-issue picture ID and one of another form of ID. I had a Social Security card, which was one of said forms of ID. I brought EVERYTHING the web site had asked me to. And she said it wasn\'t good enough.\n\nShe started bitching at me, even though I explained that this was exactly what the website said. The customer is always right, you pretentious jerk. Apparently you didn\'t learn that when you went through customer service training - if you went through it at all. Eventually I was able to find sufficient ID in my wallet, but this woman was extremely rude all the while. If you\'re working at the DMV, you damn well better know what the website says, and uphold it. Just because you chose to work in a job with rude customers doesn\'t give you the right to be rude to me.\n\nThe facility itself is actually very nice and quite large, however even so it STILL manages to get overcrowded, and wait times for things like this are unbearable. I thought getting my duplicate license made would be a pretty painless procedure, and I\'d be out of there in an hour, hour-and-a-half tops. It took OVER THREE HOURS. \n\nThe parking is terrible, it is clear whoever invented this facility didn\'t know that LOTS of people go to a DMV. It isn\'t uncommon, as a result, to have cars illegally parked on the street. Furthermore, other neighboring shopping centers have begun putting up "parking for customers only" signs, so that is looking to be less of an option. It looks like construction has begun on another parking lot, but we\'ll see what happens.\n\nAnother annoyance is that you no longer get your renewed/duplicate license/permit during your visit - they have to mail it to you now. I liked being able to leave with my license in my pocket. Why change something that wasn\'t broken in the first place? \n\nThis place either needs to be expanded or another DMV needs to be built in Henderson.

The closest libraries to our new house were the Apache Junction library (yuck and talk about a lousy selection) or Florence (a 30+ minute drive). \n\nFinally, after 5 months of whining about the Pinal County library situation and the fact that the Queen Creek Library is only 5 miles from our house but that I couldn't use it without paying a yearly fee of $50, I sucked it up and paid the fee.\n\nThe Maricopa County Library District (of which Queen Creek Library is a part) rocks! There are 17 libraries across Maricopa that this District runs and you can have any book, audiobook, movie, CD, etc transferred to your home library for no charge. Although the QC Library isn't that large, the potential list of titles you can have transferred is awe-inspiring.\n\nI also recommend checking out the book shop inside the library as they have a great selection of lightly used books for super cheap. The staff is very friendly!\n\nThe building itself is very beautiful and they have chairs and couches scattered throughout for lounging and reading.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'DESuUHNcQUULDCS9KlNVcw'}

It's several rooms of wall space as well as walkways with reasonably priced art (varying price ranges many under $100) for sale by local artists. I always see something that catches my eye. I saw a whimsical print of a woman and the same artist painted a dog; the woman print was sold BTW, so I know another person liked the piece too. Another warning, it tends to get crowded since it is a little home but if you can stand it, you might see something that you like. The collection is eclectic ranging, from landscapes to animals to the human form to thoughtful collages. Sometimes the resident artists are available. It's a must-stop for us on our First Friday trek.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'XjfKBr96h6GgrfkR_q6gIA'}

Agave Library is the perfect example of everything that is wrong with Post-Modernism.\n\nVerging away from the "form meets function" philosophy of the Modern Era, the Agave library is the least functional building I have ever seen.

They are laughably inadequate for hours of studying: the tables are not large enough to hold both a textbook and a laptop and the chairs are so uncomfortable for long periods of time. There are rows of tables for studying, but there aren\'t enough outlets for laptop users. \n\nThe book collection is tiny compared to bigger branches like Juniper. However, I really like the interlibrary loan service. It allows Phoenix Library users to rent books from any library and have them sent to any convenient branch.\n\nI really wish the City of Phoenix would refrain from trying to make a statement with every public structure.

No matter how polite you are, it will not serve you one bit...so I recommend venting your anger by voicing your complaints.\n\nOnce I voiced my complaints, I was immediately surrounded and attended to by a host of staffers, who led me away into a more private room, where my only company was two crackheads and a drunken barefooted prostitute. But these new accommodations pleased me even less than the old ones. Thankfully, all it took was 4 hours of inconsolable weeping before they upgraded my room to a larger shared suite.\n\nThis new room was similarly lacking in ambiance and decor, but at least the company was good. Say what you will about the CCDC\'s amenities -- the place is ALWAYS packed! And not with just the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, either; during my stay I met a fascinating array of prostitutes, strippers and crackheads. (OK, maybe it WAS the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, now that I think about it.)\n\nThe highlight of my experience was befriending a genial middle-aged Asian stripper with a distinctive deformity whereby her hands were missing several fingers, so that they resembled lobster claws. \n\n"You dancer?" she asked me. \n"No," I replied. \n"Why no?! You so preeeeetty!"\n"I\'d LIKE to be a dancer," I answered honestly; "I know the money\'s great... but I\'m the world\'s WORST dancer, and I\'d be laughed out of the club!"\n"No honey; it eeeeeasy! I show you!"\n\nAnd so it came to pass that I was the recipient of a lap dance in the holding tank of the CCDC by a lobster-clawed middle-aged Asian woman who had been arrested on charges of domestic violence (she beat up her husband, LOL). Amazing!\n\n"Where did you say you danced again? Spearmint Rhino?!" I found this hard to believe, since supposedly those are the hottest dancers in Vegas.\n\n"Yeah, Spearmint Rhino," she said...but then explained that they only let her dance til 9pm, then made her leave til 3am, when she was allowed back in the club. During those intervening hours, she would sometimes go dance at a less discriminating club. Like the one in the holding tank at the CCDC!\n\nFive stars for the lap dance, five stars for the company...but zero stars for everything else.\n\nWith any luck, I will NOT be returning to this establishment!', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'lRfdcptGBxolpkBPlZ358A'}

I was interested in renting a scooter, because I\'ve always wanted to own one even though I\'ve never ridden one. I found Dyad through a few google searches and trip advisor. \n\nFor a novice like me, this was an excellent place to start. The staff (and owners) were extremely helpful. They answered my initial email question promptly and I was told I wouldn\'t need a reservation. I would suggest at least calling before you go over there, in case a group of people has just shown up to rent scooters all at once. \n\nAbout the scooters - we rented what I think is called the "Smog" model. One of the owners said it was great for women to ride.\n- no gas, no plate, no drivers liscence needed\n- ride in the bike lane or the road. I thought I would rather use the bike lane, but in the end I felt safer and more comfortable in the road. Less likely to be hit by a car door opening.\n- Parking: I wish I had asked them what they suggest about parking, because I didn\'t want to take up a whole car spot in the road or just leave them on the sidwalk. Eventually we found a row of scooters and motorcycles in Old Montreal, and we left them there\n- very easy to use!\n- they were out of locks, but showed us how to lock the wheel. They seemed confident it was enough to keep the bike safe, but I think if I owned one I wouldn\'t rely on just that.\n- we took a regular battery, because we knew we weren\'t actually driving very much. I think it would have lasted for 3 hours of driving. You can pay extra for a lithium battery. \n\nThe cost: there is a $250 freeze put on a credit card when you rent. For about 2.5 hours, the cost was less than $70 for both of us. Definitely worth it. \n\nYes - I was terrified at first. My sister-in-law was also very nervous. But our "instructor" never once pushed us out the door and rushed through instructions. I know we didn\'t have to leave until we were confident. They did NOT charge us for the time spent learning how to drive, which I very much appreciate.\nAs soon as we were on the road, zoom zoom zoom! It took all of five minutes for me to feel comfortable, and I have NEVER been on a scooter or e-bike before. I didn\'t want to take them back to the store!\n\nSince renting the scooters, I have decided I want to own one! I found a place in Toronto (where I live) that rents them so I can show my boyfriend the way of the e-bike. If I find myself in Montreal for a weekend, I will definitely be back to Dyad.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'supYdMU51RA_nLlhxXbXbQ'}

An important designation when there are not too many of them left in the QC.\n\nWhen the Charlotte Checkers bolted for the shiny new uptown arena, the place was left without a major tenant, which is a bit of a shame, really, because the Checkers rarely draw more than a few thousand, and the building can hold upwards of ten thousand - plenty for hockey in Charlotte, as well as arena football, the rodeo, concerts or any number of offbeat events.\n\nNaturally you could also say that the Bobcats would not be as popular if they were not uptown - but reported attendance for the team is more than fifteen thousand.  I went to some of those games (okay, one) and there was nowhere near fifteen thousand people in that building.  Even counting season tickets would probably not get you close.  For this, we went four hundred million in debt?\n\nI get that people like the latest and greatest car, or to have a larger house than their neighbor, or a flat screen that you can see from space - but come on!  This building is perfectly serviceable, even fifty-five years after it was built.  The second Charlotte Coliseum was built, occupied and is now ground to dust.

Since we only needed the bikes for the Tour, Dave accommodated us by allowing us to pick up at closing and return the next day for a one day rental charge.)

It's an annual rite of spring for me to go to Kennywood on opening day and be among the first to ride the Phantom's Revenge.  I am that much of a coaster geek that I would push my own mother out of the way in order to be among the first riders.  \n\nSo for all you newbies, what's the Phantom like?  \n\nWell let's take a ride!  In fact, let's take two!  We'll sit in front for the view on our first ride and on our second ride, we'll sit in back for the G-forces.  The view and G-forces on this ride are simply like nothing you've ever experienced.  Are we seated comfortably, loose articles secured, and our lap bars in position?  Okay, here we go into our roll towards the lift hill!  Is your heart pounding in anticipation as the lift chain engages and we begin our ascent?  Good!  \n\nHave patience 'cos it's a slow climb as the lift chain rattles.  We can see nothing but blue skies and clouds as we ascend.  Finally we crest the lift hill as the chain disengages and for a second we can see the horizon before we do our 160 foot drop into a graceful swooping curve.  Whoa!   As we bottom out we begin hurtling towards that second hill.  See how that second hill doesn't look so high?  Ahhh, but what you uninitiated types DON'T see coming....\n\n....is the Phantom's signature second drop, a 228 foot plunge down the ravine and through the Thunderbolt's structure.  That's right!  Unlike most coasters, the Phantom's big drop is not the first, but the second.  Which also means that unlike most coasters, you're already going at almost full speed when you hit the big drop.  The Phantom has been clocked at 82 MPH when it hits the bottom!  \n\nThen we go back uphill into a sweeping fan turn and then into a reverse curve, diving thru the Thunderbolt's structure a second time before doing a couple of series of airtime bunny hops.  Finally we do the brakerun and we can breathe again!  Hoo boy!  Your stomach caught up with you yet?  Great!  Let's ride again!\n\nThe Phantom's Revenge was orignally built in 1991 as a multi-element looper, the Steel Phantom.  Behind Cedar Point's Magnum XL, it was one of the first hypercoasters built.  A decade later, with Kennywood needing a new attraction and having limited space to build one, the decision was made to refashion the Phantom.  It was converted to a terrain/ravine coaster, eliminating the loops while retaining the station, lift, and the first two drops.  \n\nUnfortunately, the Phantom's Revenge has always labored in the shadow of its more famous cousin, the Magnum XL.  But as far as I'm concerned, the Phantom has always been the far superior ride.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA'}

A "woodie" is slang for a wooden coaster.   Despite the fact that my ultimate favorite , the Phantom\'s Revenge, is a steel coaster, I actually prefer woodies.  Steel coasters may give you a quiet, smooth ride.  But for me, I love the bone-rattling, rough-riding, wheel-squealing effects of a great wooden coaster.   No it\'s not a hometown call here o\' fellow coaster geeks.  The Thunderbolt is the best one out there.  \n\nWhat makes the Thunderbolt so great?  Well for starters, parts of it are old.  It was originally built in 1924 and was known as the Pippen.  A 1968 remodeling of the ride by Andy E. Vettel expanded the ride, adding helix hills and four drops down a ravine.  The Thundebolt is essentially an out-n-back coaster with elements of a ravine/terrain coaster.  What makes this coaster so unique is that you don\'t go up the lift hill immediately out of the station.  This coaster takes such good advantage of its terrain that it drops immediately upon departure and the lift hill is in the middle.\n\nOh, and because of the design of the seats and because of the fact that the ride is so rough, you CANNOT ride alone.  You absolutely have to have a partner, even in the unlikely event that there are other empty seats on the train!  Riding by yourself or the odd person out in your group?  They\'ll find a partner for you.  \n\nReady to take a ride?  \n\nOkay, comfortable?  Any loose items secured?  Here we go.  We immediately do a drop out of the station, under the Phantom\'s Revenge.  We then go back up, take a right turn, and then hit the lift hill.  Clack, clack, clack, clack--hear that lift chain?  Okay, we\'re at the top, the chain has disengaged, another right turn, and into the Thunderbolt\'s famous bowl we go.  We gonna take a spin around here twice, then a left jog, and another drop under the Phantom.  Wheels squealing now, we make another righ towards the big finish--the tallest drop on the ride before hitting the brake run and back into the station.\n\nAs we exit the ride, have your insides caught up yet?  Have you stopped jittering?  Now you know why we had to partner up!  That thing really tosses us around in our seat!  And though the Thunderbolt may not be the tallest woodie out there, it throws its hills and turns at you fast-n-furiously!\n\nAwesome ride and it\'s an ACE (American Coasters Enthusiasts) Classic Award recipient.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA'}

Unlike most coasters which use a traditional chain and lift hill, the Sky Rocket is a launch coaster. Kennywood previously had a launch coaster, the Laser Loop, which used a catapult-like hydraulic launch. Unlike the Laser Loop, the Sky Rocket uses a synchronized magnetic induction to launch its trains up to full speed. \n\nThe ride begins by leaving the station, making a U turn, and then launching itself down a straightaway, shooting straight up a top hat tower, lingering for a nanosecond, and freefalling 90 degrees down the other side. It then goes into an inverted top hat, then some corkscrews, another drop, a barrel roll, then a few wave turns and finally some bunny hops. \n\nDesigning the Sky Rocket presented Kennywood with a few unique problems. Kennywood needed a new ride, but had very limited space in which to build one. It shows what you can accomplish when you don't have a lot of room. Unfortunately, it also shows what you have to do when you don't have a lot of room. The duration of the ride is very short--a little over a minute long. \n\nThe Sky Rocket also has another problem, about 200 miles to the northwest in Sandusky, OH. Cedar Point also has a launch coaster, the Maverick. Unfortunately, everything the Sky Rocket does, the Maverick does better. For example, whereas the Sky Rocket launches on a straightaway, the Maverick launches up hill. The Sky Rocket launches once; the Maverick has a second launch inside a tunnel. \n\nStill, to judge the Sky Rocket on its own merits, its a fun ride.

Honestly if you\'re going for date I think it\'s a good place to stroll hand in hand and enjoy the silence of a wooded garden as a break from the campus which is more and more bustling every day.\n\nI personally prefer the greenhouse and the review by Paula (who I suspect is actually a greenhouse curator) is very informative on what to do if you don\'t live on campus or have an on-campus parking pass. The greenhouse alone is in itself arguably the best in the Charlotte area. If you\'re visiting it\'s a great idea to stop by! There are multiple individual rooms all roughly categorized by plant type or location. I especially like all the rooms on the very last row down to the tropical rain forest one! It has steps down and a little waterfall area where you can sit at peace as if you were in a real rainforest.\n\nThe gardens outside have a great relaxing and nature-esque feel. In particular my friends and I have found that it\'s a great spot for photo-shoots. There are some cool "ornaments" about the garden all mostly in a red color scheme. An Asian saying on a giant upright stone slab, a huge circular gate around a walk way, a cool pagoda overlooking a pond and a cute little bridge. There are occasional nature-watch events for flowers that bloom once in a lifetime as well as multiple plant sales that go on throughout the year.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'SX5b6l8Isbi7VbjK-eilIQ'}

We didn't know that he was sick when we agreed to foster him for the night (prior to the adoption.)  As we were leaving with him, we were asked to bring him back the next day to get medicine since, we were told, that some of the some of the dogs at the rescue had kennel cough.  The first night went okay but I was wondering why all he did was sleep and did not seem to have the energy of a normal puppy.  We returned the next morning to adopt him and get his medicine.  \nBy the second day at our house, he was not eating and had terrible coughing fits.  I took him to the vet.  \nHe has a upper respitory infection, kennel cough, possible phenomia, ticks and a parasite, in addition to being dehyrated.  I have taken him to the vet twice in three days to check his condition, run tests, and given him fluids.  He also has been given more medicine to treat the infection and parasites.  \nI am happy to say that he seems to be improving but have since found out that there were other puppies at the rescue center that were infected with the parvo virus.  \nI know this rescue is trying to only do good for these animals but I would be very careful if you are considering adoption or fostering.\n  I believed that I was getting a healthy puppy, instead I got a very sick puppy.  We have already spent a lot of money at the vet, in the attempt to get him better.  I do believe that taking him when we did, may have saved his life.  \nI was not offered my adoption money back even though I told the rescue that I would not be taking him back for shots or the microchip. (Both of which she does herself and that was what the adoption fee covered.)  I will pay for the vacinations to be done through my vet.  I also do not want this little puppy to go through a painful experience of getting microchipped when he has already been through so much.  \nIn the 2 weeks that this rescue center had our puppy, he was neutered, had a rabies shot and a vacination.  That seems to be alot for a 3 month, 6 pound puppy.

In my opinion, this service is FAR easier to deal with than all the overpriced cabs and lame airport shuttles. You can catch the Westcliff Airport Express for just 2 bucks one way, $3 for a two hour pass, or $5 for an all day pass. Anytime I head to or from the airport I always leave my car at the Centennial Hills Park & Ride and take this express service down, it's easy, fast and ecomomical. For more information on this route just check Google Maps on your phone and tap theblue bus icon, call (702)228-7433, or go to rtcsnv.com", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'YVyzM5JuquEGmSxWrlXzeg'}

DMV offices ALWAYS get a bad rap, but at this office, the employees truly try to make the process more efficient and were all very pleasant tempered and personable. True, they are understaffed, but that blame lies largely on the state and budget issues, not the department or this location. I used to go to the "hidden" old location on Idewild and had similar experiences. So maybe when they moved locations, the staff traveled with.\n\nI went in on a Friday morning right when they opened at 8 and there was only about five people in line. That being said, I still recommend making an appointment as soon as you receive a notice in the mail. I made my appointment a full month before my license was set to expire and the earliest appointment I could get was not even a week before my license expired. Do not wait! When I left about 15 minutes after i got there (make an appointment, seriously, you will be in and out in a fraction of the time.) there were about 10 people waiting for their numbers to be called and three people in line to pull tickets.\n\nI would have given 5 stars, but they DON\'T TAKE PLASTIC! be prepared to have cash or check.

It can have very quick service or you can get a clerk that's so slow that you want to claw your eyes out with a fork. Sometimes though its the customers that make you wonder if maybe there's a full moon out there.\n\nThe branch has mailbox services, 2 automated postal centers, a satellite counter that may or may not be open & a long main counter that can have up to three clerks.This branch also has a passport office but most folks never find out where it is until they've stood in line for half an hour.\n\nThe passport office is located on the back side of the building. You have to drive around the right side of the building past Char 7 Bar till you come to a chain link fence. The office will be the door closest to the fence. It really helps speed up the passport process if you have the form already filled out. The clerk will walk you through every line on the form so be prepared to be there for awhile.

They all look like they are miserable and hate working there, but when you talk to them; they are actually pretty friendly people providing you with some quality customer service.  I give this place a 3 stars though due to the fact that something is always up with their self-serve drop box.  I'm not sure what the exact term for it is, but basically you can help yourself at an electronic kiosk thing (if you are shipping something).  The actual process is quick, easy, user-friendly, and efficient, but the drop box that you put your package in is always full or broken (it won't even open).  This is the reasoning behind my 3 stars.  On top of that, they only have 2 clerks running the line (at least every time I go and I've gone during all times of the day and week), making for a very time-consuming wait if you do not want to use the electronic kiosk.\n\nPros:\n * Clean, Well- maintained location\n * Priority boxes are always stocked (I find this to be a problem at other USPS locations)\n * they have the self-service electronic kiosk\n * passport services and P.O Boxes available\n\nCons:\n * Drop box is always full or broken\n * Always busy\n * Not enough clerks running the line\n\nOverall:\n  I'd be fibbing if I were to say I'd never go here again.

I found that my life was dramatically altered.  I had gone to the emergency room and told that I had a sprain... (how do you do that sleeping?? ) (don\'t worry St Rose will get a yelp too!!) So by Wednesday when bedrest and percocet did not help me to be able to walk again... I called my friend who\'s husband is a doctor to see who she would suggest as a foot specialist ... she and I both went on my insurance\'s website CIGNA.  Where we found that this doctor\'s office was a preferred provider ...  BONUS!\n\nThey could get me in that day! DOUBLE BONUS!\n\nWhen I  got to the office , they took my insurance information, Had me fill out forms and then I waited to see the doctor.\nAfter my visit , when I checked out I was told "You are all good we will see you in two weeks after your bedrest"\nI figured this was because I had already met my out of pocket expense with the emergency room visit. \n\nTwo weeks later- when still not walking surgery was scheduled . \nI again checked out asked abouta copay and was told .. nope have a good day!\n\nSurgery scheduled and also post ops scheduled. \n\nI had my surgery. Then a week later I had my first post op visit.  \nI checked out and again no copay -Suh-weeeet! I was loving my insurance! Meeting your out of pocket expense rocks! \n\nI had two other post op visits - when at the last one I was told.\n"hmm you have a balance. you might want to start paying on this."\n\nMe: Balance ... why is that I met my out of pocket expense.\n\nOffice- Well we are not a preferred provider.\n\nMe What are YOU talking about I found you listed under preferred providers from my insurance and everytime I have come in you haven\'t said one thing.\n       you are telling me this AFTER I have surgery.\nOffice- well you can appeal it with Cigna -\nMy sister was silently fuming beside me - since she had to drive me to all of my doctors visits since i couldn\'t walk.\nDon\'t you think you should have said something prior to her surgery? Like the first visit when she saw you?\nOffice - we aren\'t sure what happened with that.\nMe - err ok well I wil definitely be appealing.\n\nI went home and checked Cigna\'s website and conveniently ... the doctor and his office were conveniently no longer on the website.\n\nConvenient!\n\nI quickly called Cigna and got the appeal process and just as quickly wrote a letter requesting an appeal.\nMonths pass by .. I receive NO bill from the doctor and no denial of appeal from my insurance. \n\nWhen I get a knock at my door and am being told that I am being sued for 1200.00. For charges from Las Vegas Food and ankle.\n\nErrr WTH?\n\nI am at this point shaking I am so angry. \n\nI was told that in the state of nevada that you do not have to get a bill.. a bill is a courtesy .. and that it is the patients responsibility to see if they hyave a balance. \nare you kidding me with that?\nNOPE!\n\nI am paying the bill which Iwould have no problem paying if it had not been for the fact that I asked EVERY single time I went in if there was a copay ... or anyting I needed to do... I was told at every sing turn NO there is no bill you are all good.... Until that last doctors visit.\nI feel that the office staff has a responsibility to let the patient know if they have changed their status with an insurance company because patients go in trusting that the office will not steer them wrong and that they are there to help the patient understand what coverages apply to their office.\n\nI used to be a secretary for a OB/GYN practice and believe me I discussed insurance and whether a patient was covered or not covered EVERY single visit. \n\nI honestly have never felt so .... deceived. \n\nSo do I recommend the doctors..

Everyone has coffee and snacks first, though, and then enjoys the talk. Child care is provided for most functions. \n\nThe church is on N 20th Street, on the right just before 20th St dead-ends into Bethany Home.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'aTi0NVrcPJWbN6jAsJVcAw'}

They have a modern-looking VIP lounge/studio attached to the gift shop, bar, and waiting area (with sofas).  They also have a 3D simulator, so as to get the experience from the driver\'s seat, as well as the passenger seat.  \n\nThe attendants that work there fitted me with a hairnet and helmet while I was waiting to take my lap (as a passenger) while I stared at the line of Ferraris.  Oooh.  Then, one of the coordinators motioned me over and I found my car.\n\nNote: I don\'t recommend taking a purse, and they have an area that looks like a closet where you can leave your personal belongings, but I opted to have the attendant hold mine while I was on the track. \n\nAs soon as I was buckled into my seat, I knew that I was in for an experience.  The driver greeted me, made some conversation, but then immediately took off quite quickly during the lap.  Yep, he drove the car "like it was stolen."  Exhilarating, definitely.  I could see now why they told me not to have my purse with me, as I was almost flying around on my side of the car while gripping the oh $!@# handle for dear life and securing my cell phone.  Haha.  Unfortunately, the lap ended too quickly for my taste, I was returned to the starting area, and collected my belongings.  I did, however, overhear one of the guys directing the flow of riders telling the driver not to take it too fast.  Hehe.  \n\nWhen I got back to the VIP lounge/reception area, I chugged some champagne, ate some appetizers, toured the gift shop, sat in the 3D simulator, and snapped a few pics of the Ferrari F430GT that was on display.  \n\nFor me, I definitely think that the ride along was the way to go, since I\'d probably be too nervous and scared of crashing the car (even if there was an instructor with me) to ride fast/enjoy the experience.  \n\nI\'ll definitely be returning, though, since their prices are pretty competitively priced:\n\n-2 laps as as passenger for $179\n-5 laps as a driver with access to the simulator, training session, shuttle service from Crystals, access to the VIP lounge, certificate for $500 \n\nI just hope that they don\'t get booked up too quickly, since they seem to only have availability (generally) on Tuesdays, Thursdays-Saturdays.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'v-HksoosvZozoWmkKr7gSA'}

I can ask myself the same questions.  I\'ve found myself standing before judges, for judgment at least twice, been called dumb (rightly so in that instance) by The State (DPS officer in another state), etc.\n\nI\'ve been called for jury duty several times in two states.  Every time I get into the process I am grateful to live in a place on earth where a person or people accused of violating The State\'s rules of Civil behavior can be judged guilty or innocent by a group of people, guided by a Judge; not by a king, duke or prince, a dictator, angry mob, or a general who might bill my family for the bullet.  \n\nJury duty is a place We the People can feel and see our system of governance working.   A way of sitting in on the creation of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.  So\'s voting.  You can be sure you register to vote here too.  \n\nThat\'s the shining ideal.  I respect and love it.  We know when the idea is exercised shining ideals get tarnished.  That\'s the nature of humans, power and justice at this point in history.  Generally speaking, the legal system of this nation works.  Over recent past decades its begun working better for every American.  \'\n\nFor me the juror, the most amazing thing about the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County is the new building.  During past calls to jury duty, I\'ve sat hours in dingey brown rooms with uncomfortable, worn out, or both seating.  When you arrive for jury duty here it is state of the art in a well designed setting.  You\'re checked in through a computer kiosk, issued a badge via printer and can walk to either a large break or group seating area.\n\nThe break room\'s got a few tables set up for laptop or tablet workstations.  There\'s a coffee service and small cinnamon rolls.  There are several large flat panels throughout the area with some kind of media playing.   \n\nThe main waiting hall has comfy seating, and again, a medley of monitors.  These monitors have different content.  They run a series of informational programs explaining the judicial system, the individual\'s role as a juror, and display information for people called to various jury panels.  Another video details Arizona\'s exemplary system of selecting judges and assuring they are fit for duty.  If you choose, you can watch them before you come in for jury duty.  They play from the Jury Services Home Page.   \n\nJury duty may seem like a pain.  But if you\'re going to be part of the legal process and called to duty, there\'s no better place to serve in the 21st century than at the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County.    \n\nI expect there may be flames from this post....', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'Ry48Bta6spNowOkiMNC_xg'}

Are you a resident of the City of Henderson? (Or Clark County for that matter?) If this is you please consider taking a look at the City of Henderson's Animal Shelter. It's about 1 mile East of I-515 on Galleria and about 1/2 mile East of Boulder Highway. While it's in an out of the way location, it's worth your time to seek this place out. \n\nEarlier today (4/7/12) we visited the shelter with the intent to just look...we've been reviewing shelters online (Yelp has quite a few great ones to check out) and the animals they have up for adoption. We decided to visit the Henderson Shelter on our way to somewhere else, but we never had to go anywhere else. We found the animal we wanted right there. While they have cats, birds, even ferrets, they had several dogs available, and it was not full of the typical pitbulls or chihuahuas either. (We had 18 to choose from). Small dogs can be adopted on the spot, larger dogs do require what's called a home check. The City of Henderson will AT NO CHARGE send out someone to inspect your property to make sure it has a 6 foot high fence and a working gate. Don't let this scare you off, it won't take long to do, and again it's at NO CHARGE to you for the large animal home check. (They basically peek over the fence to make sure it's 6 foot high, check the gate to make sure it's secured so the wind won't open it and let your animal go exploring Henderson and Las Vegas, and you don't have to be home, it's about as non-invasive as it gets). If this is freaking you out check out their website to read up on it or give them a call and they'll explain it. \n\nWe ended up looking for a smaller dog and we found one that we liked and more imnportantly he liked us. So we decided to adopt it on the spot. The adoption process was quick and hassle free. (Under 15 min, if that, and that's only because someone was finishing up ahead of me!) I signed a couple of forms for the city, one to update the microchip info, and my debit card receipt and that's it. We were quickly heading outside with the perfect dog, and with the satisfaction that we rescued a shelter dog too!\n\nSpecial Note: The staff as in every single one I spoke to was simply awesome to work with. Service with a smile from start to finish here. Now they are a little busy so be patient, but when they get to you they answer any questions you could possibly have. They have small rooms where you can take the animals in and see if they like you and vice versa  (this is a serious melting point, don't say you weren't warned). The only nitpick I could ding them on is the outside area could use a powerwasher taken to it, but it's still one of the best looking, and cleanest city shelters I've ever been in. \n\nI can't recommend this place enough. Here's a sneak peek at the pricing too...and you get one heck of a deal for the price. Go price the individual services, shots, microchipping, etc individually and you will step back and say WOW. \n\nFrom the website as of 4/7/12:\n\nAdoption fees.\n\n    Our cats/kittens are adopted for $55.00 each.\n\n    Our dogs/puppies are adopted for $65.00 each.\n\n    Ferrets are adopted for $55.00 each.\n\n    These fees include the routine vaccines, spay or neuter surgery if not already done, microchip ID and registration, and a Rabies tag or Henderson License (depending on where you live).\n\n    We take cash, checks, and major credit cards as form of payment.\n\nAlong with your adoption papers they offer super cool local discounts on pet washes, a 48 hour free checkup at a long list of various vets, and even discounted photography options which I intend to use and hopefully I can review those for Yelp too! \n\n5 Stars, Highly, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'Qx9MnE4R-g70HyF468O8dA'}

When you walk into Randyland you may be initially overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff that surrounds you, but as you take it all in will start to notice that, strangely, it all just fits together.  A few minutes after we entered, Randy, the owner who can best be described as a curious combination of Bob Ross/Willy Wonka/Bob Dylan, came out to greet us and that is when the fun began.  Never have I met an individual who was so genuinely excited to talk to and share something with other people.  A self-proclaimed eccentric, Randy shared with us the history behind the property and spoke passionately about its purpose- a place of self expression where negativity and hate are left at the door- and his hopes for its future.  Randy\'s goal is to raise enough money to pay off the property and then donate it to a local organization for use as a museum and center for aspiring artists, classes, etc.  Randy claims to not be an "artist", but anyone who takes a tour through Randyland would certainly beg to differ.\n\nIf you do come to check out Randyland, be prepared to stay for a while.  Not only are there a plethora of painted walls, doors, pots, etc. and hundreds of re-purposed items to look at, but as Randy mentioned an article once noted about him- you ask him a question and are answered with a waterfall.  Not only will Randy share his unique perspective on life, but he will also share a wealth of information about the history of Pittsburgh, particularly the North Side.\n\nWords really cannot do justice, so do yourself a favor and head over to the North Side and check it out for yourself.

There weren't too many people there yet so we were able to find good seats in the front left portion of the seating area.  Now the waiting began.  \nI never have been good at sitting in one area waiting for something to start.  I used to do that when the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings movies came out at midnight but after awhile I got worn down.  I decided to get up and walk around to check out the surrounding area.  They have a center there with all the pictures and statues of Christ in the building to the south of the play area.  There were missionaries there talking to people about their church.  The bathrooms were closed inside, but they had portable bathrooms out to the east of the visitor's center.  The best time to use the bathrooms is at least 30 minutes before the play starts because I went back there right before and it was packed with people.  \n When I was younger we would sit out on the back lawn area where you can spread out blankets.  For families, that is the best place to sit, although the view is not as good because it is far away from the stage.  One problem I realized, people were saving seats, which is not allowed.  People would come without their families to save 15-20 seats, and their families would come 20 minutes before the play.  The people coming before then are out of luck.  It was especially difficult when it was the last 30 minutes before the play because so many people were coming all at once.  The hosts have a difficult job working with the people who are saving the seats.  \n The whole time I was waiting I saw large families with young kids, elderly families, and middle aged families spending time together.  For me that is the purpose of the event is to bring families together.  The lights go out at 8 o'clock so you will want to be in your seat then because it is hard to see when they go off.  Any where you sit, the sound system is amazing.  You won't have a problem hearing from anywhere in the area.  The play was amazing with dancing, narrating, acting, etc.  Anyone who loves theatre would enjoy the play.\nThe end of the play is tough, though.  With around 20,000 people all bunched together it could be rather slow getting out, and if you are like me you will not want to wait.  I suggest sitting in an area on the side so you can make a quick exit to get to your car to beat all the other cars out.  For not having been for a few years it was a great experience with my family that I will enjoy next year.  The Easter Pageant is one of those events that only takes place once a year.  I would suggest to anyone to attend next year.  I had a great experience and know you will too.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'jl3tWaMk-SJ_hVIPwYwaSg'}

Looks like my review of The Racer was somehow merged into my main review of Kennywood Park.  So here it is again.\n\nThe Racer is Kennywood's second oldest rollercoaster after the Jack Rabbit. Built in 1927, it's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster. What's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster? Well it's a racing coaster that appears to have two continuous loops (ala the American Eagle at Six Flags or the Gemini at Cedar Point), but really has only one continuous track. So you end up on the opposite side of the station from where you started. There are only three remaining coasters of this type in the world. The other two are in Mexico City and Blackpool. \n\nThe Racer was designed and built by John Miller and its trains are classics built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. PTC built some of some of the most famous coasters and their trains. Its tallest vertical height is 76 feet, its maximum drop is 50 feet, and its top speed is 40mph. Of the three woodies at Kennywood (this, the Jack Rabbit and the Thunderbolt), the Racer is the only one in which the initial hill is also the lift hill. When built, it cost the then-princely sum of $76,000! Imagine what the designers back then would have thought of what the newest coasters cost! \n\nReady to take a ride? \n\nOkay, let's get on the train on the right! It doesn't really matter where we sit on this one, so maybe we'll just park in the middle. The alarm bell rings, the brakes are released and we begin rolling towards the lift hill. We won't see our opponents until we're almost on the lift hill. The lift chain catches and we're inching our way up the hill. We're about a foot in front of them. We see the warning sign as near the top telling us not to stand up. Well duh, but I'll bet some moron has tried that! \n\nThe lift chain releases and we we're down the first drop, then a quick ascent, then a reverse curve. Because we're on the inside of the curve, we pull out to an early lead. Uh oh, that can't be good. Read on. We keep our early lead for awhile but remember, sometimes we're on the inside curve, sometimes on the outside. The great thing about the Racer is that some of the curves are so tight, we can reach out and high-five our opponents.  Remember, it's not a tradition--it's a requirement! \n\nThe present Racer replaced an earlier one built in 1910, which was a side-friction coaster like Leap the Dips at Lakemont Park. The present Racer's cars are locked to the track, thus allowing banked curves as well as dips on the curves. We can see how this has come into play 'cos even though we've been ahead, on the final curve our opponents have pulled into a late lead and are first back into the station! \n\nShite! We lost! \n\nThe Racer really doesn't have the G-forces or the airtime hills of the Jack Rabbit or the Thunderbolt. It doesn't have the Thunderbolt's speed or wicked drops either. But it's still got a great rough ride and it's still a blast. The Racer is an ACE (American Coasters Enthusiasts) Classic and on June 21st, 2010 the Racer was declared an ACE Coaster Landmark.", 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA'}

No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.\nMe: I see.  \n\n**These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**\n\nFirst off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. \n\nAll my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. \n\nThe Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. \n\nAmong the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. \n- Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox\n- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod\n- A cat on a hat\n- Legos\n- Colon photos\n- 100+ year old stuffed fox\n- Old electro-shock machine\n- Jar of human teeth\n- Jar of human skin flakes\n- Jar of human finger and toe nails\n- Tentacles\n- A family of amphibians\n- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five\n- Steampunk bears\n- Bindle stick bundles\n- A gerbil named 'poop'\n- Ray guns\n- Gimp-type masks\n- Original Addams family goodies\n- Carnival treasures\n- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse\n- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats\n- And soooo much more...\n\nWhen you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': '7zpDhrRZRTGCkAh3SHbEww'}

Countryside is an awesome park, they also have separate areas for big and small dogs, but we chose to just stick to the big dogs side (even though we have a 6 pound Morkie) She can hang. Lola loved playing with the 90 lb rottweiler named Stretch and all the other dogs. The feel at this park is similar to Cosmo in that all the owners are familiar with each other because they come so often, but this dog park seems more community oriented. There was an older lady and one of the dog owners brought her a folding chair, the owners share and bring large coolers for water and treats for everyone. All owners watch their dogs and play with other dogs as well. There are plenty of benches and water fountains for the pups. The one thing I like about this park in comparison to Cosmo Dog Park in Gilbert is the fact that the grass is a bit healthier and its less dirty. Lola gets pretty dirty at Cosmo,  but she seemed pretty good at this park because there were no dry grass bits sticking to her fur.  The only thing that grossed me out was BIG dogs= BIG poops. One owner neglected to clean up after her dog, perhaps she was just excited to socialize with the other dog owners, but it kind of erked me. \n\nLove this place, Clean up after your pets!\n\nHere are some other facts about the place:\n\n*The off leash area is closed on Tuesdays for maintenance. \n*The park has lighted baseball fields, bbq's, picnic tables, Ramada's, and walking trails!", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': '7jWmd57QoJnq2q4QyvVS2Q'}

Cuts not only puts innocent and honest officers out of jobs, but it also makes the community far more dangerous and puts these officers in more imminent danger since they can be outnumbered. \n\nI got the opportunity to volunteer with NLVPD and be a part of their Citizen's Academy. It was truly a enriching experience. I got to meet a lot of officers who specialize in different fields such as narcotics, K9, homicide detectives, and SWAT. They all shared their experiences and taught us a brief overview of their expertise. Boy is there a lot more than what the media displays. The kind of pressure they have is so unappreciated and undermined. \n\nBeing a part of NLVPD's Citizen's Academy also allowed me to do a 10 hour ride along with their officers, in which I got to follow an officer do his duty throughout the day. And I got to wear a Kevlar vest! Nevertheless, a very rewarding experience. I got to experience real life crimes ranging from domestics to stabbing. (Yes with a knife). Even had to witness a fatal auto-pedestrian accident. By the time the officer and I reached the hospital, they put the sheet over him, which means that he had died. I was fortunate enough to experience an unfortunate event. Only to humble me and teach me that life can end that quickly.\n\nOther than my rewarding experiences, these officers deserve just as much as credit as Metro has received. The amount of pressure they have to patrol a city that is similar to South Central, yet, a greedy city manager that's breathing down their necks to cut officers and cut their pension, only for the manager himself to maintain his outrageous benefits. Don't believe what the media says and respect the men who are putting their lives on the line just to ensure the safety of a mightily struggling community.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'AumBuTaqFZ6xNuHjkg7kIw'}

The forms say all puppies are up-to-date on their shots including parvo, distemper, and rabies. We adopted a dog from them and they were aware that we had two other dogs at home. I noticed the dog we were adopting had an eye issue and when I asked about it, I was told that he just had allergies and that it would go away. We took the dog home only to find out that he was hacking and wheezing after play, had bowel issues, and had extremely irritated eyes the next day. When I reviewed his shot records, the only record we received was of one parvo shot that the dog had received that was already out of date.  After calling the agency, and being treated very rudely when I asked for the shot record, it was made known that the dog had been exposed to parvo as a puppy and also previously had an upper respiratory infection. I discovered through my own research that an upper respiratory infection is also known as the highly contagious dog infection known as Bordatellla. I had also asked the agency during our adoption if the dog had received this shot as I had other dogs at home and I was simply told that he had received the Bordatella shot. \n\nAfter we did some investigating and finally found the vet office that the rescue uses we made some calls to see if we could get vaccine records from the vet office. The vet office called Ohana and were told conflicting information from what we had been told. The vet office told us that Deanna Arroyo gave the dogs the vaccines herself so there was no record of what was given and Deanna stated to them she specifically told us "the dog had received the shots that we had on our shot record form". The only shot listed was an outdated parvo vaccine.  The vet office also told us that Deanna didn\'t always do what they recommended she do for the best health of the dogs at the shelter and they had heard from another client she recommended that the dog owner feed their dog raw meat. Who does that?\n\nWe understand that many shelters have exposure to puppy diseases. What we are most frustrated about is the lack of communication that the organization had with us. We feel like we were "tricked" into adopting a dog from and lied to from the beginning about the history of the dog. They could have fixed this problem by politely working with us to get the dog properly vaccinated and taken care of at the vet but instead they were rude, failed to return phone calls, and only agreed to pay for a stool sample and a vet check not including any medication or required shots. I\'m trying to figure out where the money we gave them for the adoption fees went. The dog\'s sister\'s owner has also been having difficulty receiving shot records from Ohana.\n\nGiven that we have two healthy dogs at home, we are extremely frustrated and stressed that it was not brought to our attention ahead of time that this dog had a history of illness that could affect our other dogs. We have had to take time off from work and school to get this issue taken care of.\n\nIf you choose to adopt from this agency, be sure to ask lots of questions and triple check all of the records and shot records.

A lady asked the 5 of us I'm the first waiting area if we were registering guns or filing a report. She told us they were short staffed and couldn't stay a minute after 5:00. That they might not be able to get to us. We could write out a statement but there was NO guarantee we could file a report. I'd already been there over an hour so oh hell let's see how this goes. \nWe'll at 5:25 (remember they couldn't stay a minute after 5:00) my number gets called. I go to the window and the lady asks what I need. So I tell her why I'm there. Not much story or detail to a stolen license plate. She tells me that she couldn't file a report because it would take too long. Something about inputting it in the computer and emails blah blah blah she lost me at no.

Time to change that because while this facility is part of Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn, it is a stand alone facility with everything you need in one locations.\n\nI am currently 9 months pregnant with my first so this review is based on my four experiences with complications I had that lead me to the triage department and a four day stay at Labor and Delivery.  \n\nOne of the best things about this facility is that it is stand alone from the hospital.  You have your own building away from the hustle and bustle of the main hospital.  You have your own entrance, your own triage center, and your own staff specific to OB which helps in having nurses and aides who understand what you are going through.  \n\nWhen you come in they are quick to get you checked in and taken back to the triage area.  There are about 7-8 beds in triage and a staff dedicated to that area.  3 out of 4 times I had amazing staff in the triage area of the facility.  The only poor experience is when they didn't believe the information I was relaying based on when my personal doctor told me.  This was rectified the next day by a very stern phone call from my regular OB.  They are extremely helpful in getting you comfortable, hooked up to the monitors, and assisting your through out your stay.  Three out of the four times I was in triage for a couple of hours, monitored, treated, and sent home.  The fourth time I was admitted.  Attached to the triage center is 2 operating rooms for c-sections.  Again one stop shop.\n\nThe facility has a level 2 nursery on site if needed but they encourage the baby to room in with mom.  Be for-warned, if you have a preemie baby or one with complications they may be transferred up to the Shea site which has the the level 3 NICU.\n\nThe Labor and Delivery rooms are spacious and are equipped with everything you need to labor and deliver in.  The private bathroom has a shower and a jet tub to help you relax.  I spent four nights on L&D for pre-term labor and hooked up to several IV's.  The on-call doctors and nurses were beyond wonderful and accommodating to us while we were there.  They explained all of the procedures I was facing and what meds did what and how I would react to them.  They bought me a table top fan to help with the overheating side effects from the meds.  I felt like I was demanding at times but they said I was a pretty easy patient.  Dr. Moon was my on call doctor over the weekend and she was thorough, engaging, and extremely helpful.\n\nI did not have a single nurse ratchet during my stay.  Some were not necessarily as talkative as others but all had very good bedside manner and were polite.  The rooms are private and spacious although I do know that the post labor rooms are a little smaller.  It is very quiet and I hardly ever saw or heard any other patients unless I was in triage.  The hospital food is okay...it's hospital food, but they are okay with you bringing in outside food.  \n\nWhile It stinks that I've already had so many experiences there already, it puts my mind at ease knowing that I will be well cared for when I go in to active labor. \n\nHighly recommended.", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'xqsk4LUMt2T9a3GGHQwpug'}

Apparently, my mail route (downtown Vegas, near the Huntridge Station) doesn\'t have a regular mailman, so my mail is always getting lost/fucked up/etc. Any time anyone sends me anything registered (where I have to sign for it), I unfailingly miss the mailman, and get one of those little cards in the mail: "Your letter is at the Sunrise Carrier Unit, come pick it up." PAIN IN THE ASS! Why can\'t they hold it at a closer station?? I\'d be more than happy to go to the Huntridge Station -- right down the street. Why make me venture all the way out here??!\n\nI won\'t bore you with more griping about the inefficiency of the USPS -- we\'ve all been there, done that.

Shocker, I missed the mailman (mailmen, since my route doesn\'t have a single person), so I go down in person to pick it up at the time/date shown on the card they left. Of course they can\'t find the letter, so the guy tells me to call back in the morning between 8-9am to speak to my carrier. This I do, but of course come to find out I HAVE no carrier, so they tell me they\'ll call me back. Of course they never do. It took a week of phone calls and in-person visits to get to the bottom of this. On one of my visits, the guy at the front was really snarky with me, like all this was MY fault. I\'m not the one who lost the fuckin\' letter, asshole! FINALLY he admitted that the letter had been returned to sender -- for what reason I cannot fathom, as I was down there all the time trying to track it down. FUCKERS!\n\nI recently had occasion to visit again, and it was just as bad. The mailman left a postcard, but it had someone else\'s name in the address field. I figured it was probably not my concern, but just to make sure I tried to call and find out what I should do. Of course, all I can find online is the 800 number for the entire fucking USPS. A lady told me based on the date on the postcard, I have two more days to go down in person and see if it\'s mine. So I drive allllll the way out there, only to be sniped at by Ginger McAssBeard that I\'m too late, they got rid of it a long time ago. WTF!! Then why did the dumbass on the phone tell me I had two more days?! Get your story straight, people!\n\nBUMBLING INCOMPETENCE! I can\'t WAIT until this obsolete service goes out of business.

There is a "CSI" type game where you go from station to station and look for clues and solve a mystery.  There is arts and crafts area and more climbing up.  So much fun.\n\nI know I am leaving out a lot, but we were there for over 2 1/2 hrs. and there was still so much to explore.

Go anywhere other then this \'Hospital\'\nMy husband and I decided that he needed to go to the ER to get assessed because he woke up in the morning with these large bumps on both of his legs just beneath his knees. His legs swollen, tender, and very red and hot to the touch. He began to develop raised bumps on his chest, back, and arms. It seemed to progress pretty quickly. My husband never complains about anything and absolutely avoids Dr\'s and would never dream of an ER visit unless he thought something was seriously wrong. I am a Registered Nurse and specialize in med/surg and after monitoring him throughout the day we decided to go down and be seen. I\'m not positive but I thought it may be Erythema Nodosum, but I cannot diagnose of course, that would be up to the Dr. \nHe checked in and was triaged very quick and then brought back to one of the beds. A male nurse came inland asked what was going on and we explained his signs and symptoms and gave a detailed report over the last 24 hours. The nurse was not paying attention at all while we talking. He did not do anything other then a quick glance and then exited the room. \nNext the Dr came in and paid even less attention then  the nurse. Now the Dr just stood for a minute and she did not assess my husband or even slightly exam the affected areas. Now my husband had flu like symptoms over the last few weeks and had generalized fatigue. The Dr did not ask for any history, did not do an exam, and turned and left the room without saying one thing to us or even give us an opinion as to what it could be.\nI never mention that I\'m a nurse when I go to the Dr or clinc or wherever  as that could work against us.Wells a few minutes later the nurse came back in with discharge papers and an Rx for two antibiotics ( Keflex and Bactrim) as well as a oral prednisone.  No information, no exam, no review of history of other acute symptoms and he was handed his paperwork and said we could go. My husband was so mad because he was given no information and no medical advise at all. We asked the RN if we really were being released and the nurse said "what would you like us to do" Nice bedside manner you uncaring idiot. \nWe left, husband very upset and " we need your $125.00 co-pay"\nEven if it was something minor we should have at least been educated and given a rational for the antibiotics Now anyone in the medical field with direct patient care knows how important education is. Had we been just two people  with no medical back ground, we should have at least been informed on the importance of taking the antibiotics as prescribed, even when you are feeling better. Wow! Medication such as antibiotics have to be completed properly and many patients do not know this. So much for quality care and we will never use this "hospital" again. \nAbsolutely horrible service and care. \nHopes this helps even one person if they have a choice where to receive care.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'Nkcyr3rQ2H7_J38KS5tPhg'}

It generally functions 1 out of every 7 trips I take. Despite your ticket saying so, not all buses have outlets. I've also seen passengers turned away and told they need to wait for the next bus (4 hours later) because the driver was using all 4 front seats for their belongings. An absolute insult to their customers. I have had a lot of other bad experiences with Greyhound but will keep them to myself in hopes that they are one time incidents that would otherwise reflect poorly on the company.

You then move freely among the wax people, whom(which?) you can freely grope and snap pics with. The rooms are themed (more or less), a big favourite being the "Sports room" with Wayne Gretzky, Crosby and Terry Fox among others. \n\nWhat\'s fun is looking if whether or not the statue does your favourite actor/singer/politician justice, as well as getting lost in the decors (epic decors!). Another fun thing is testing your general culture against that of other museum goers (apparently nobody cares/knows who Andy Warhol or Jimmy Hendrix are, but then again, my history is rusty and I couldn\'t identify this general or that nun, or even some Hockey great, so...).

Champlain if she lives thousands of miles up north? Is this an Iroquois, or a Miqmak family? Nope, just random Indians, ya know? Who knows if the costumes are accurate? The only First Nations people credited are the ones who collaborated with the settlers (a Chief, no tribe) or took on the settler\'s culture (the first Aborigenal Saint).

S, and pertaining to this review, the "S" stands for "Saving you money parking at McCarran International Airport." And to save money parking at McCarran International Airport, my advice is to follow the blue and white signs to the Economy Parking Lot.\n\n  Long-term parking in the Economy Parking lot is far less $ than the McCarran Terminal 1 parking garage. Long-term parking at Terminal 1 currently costs $16 a day whereas long-term parking at the Economy parking lot is $10 a day. That $6 savings a day adds up! When we left the car at Economy parking during the week we were in Seattle, we saved $42. If we were away for two weeks, we would of saved $84 parking here.\n\n   The thing about spending way less money to park at the Economy Parking lot over the Terminal 1 long-term parking is that you are not going that much out of your way. The Economy parking lot is just north of Terminal 1. There is a shuttle that travels between Economy Parking and the Terminal 1 Zero Lot. I would estimate you can board one at 15 minute intervals. The shuttles are comfortable. Every shuttle driver, who greatly appreciates a tip, has been friendly. There had been a few times where the shuttle driver has dropped us off right at the car. The ride itself is 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n  The Economy parking lot is the equivalent of a few football fields of concrete. There has never been an issue of trying to find a parking spot. There has likewise never been an issue with safety. A problem I could see happening is somebody becoming so absorbed in travelling that they forget where they parked.\n\n   The Zero Lot, where the shuttle drops you off and picks you up at Terminal 1 is an identical distance from long-term parking. It is a moderate walk to ticketing (McCarran is so large) and relatively easy walk from baggage claim. Another word about the Zero Lot is that there is plenty of shade. So on hot days it is not a painfully uncomfortable experience waiting there.\n\n  When it comes to long-term parking at McCarran International Airport, my check-ins resume at Economy Parking. A saving of $6 a day adds up. In our case it added up to $42 (more money for yelping at restaurants). And to me $42 saved is $42 earned.\n\nThe 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge.

The trails are well-maintained and every trail we walked on was mowed grass, not dirt or gravel.  The wildflowers are gorgeous on the trails through the prairie and the mosquitoes were a bit bad in the woodsy trails (but that\'s everywhere this time of year, unfortunately).   \n\nWhile dogs are allowed on-leash on the hiking trails there also is an off-leash dog park.  One nice touch here is that they have two separate areas - a regular dog park and then a separate area for "small dogs".  A very nice touch for those who may feel out-sized at many other dog parks.

I like this park because it's close to home and offers enough space that we can actually avoid lots of other dogs when we want/need to.  When we've been here, most people seem to do a lot of walking around the park instead of standing in one spot and playing.  If you want your dog to have lots of play time I'd recommend hanging out near the entrance or else heading to Brittingham dog park.  In terms of walking/hiking, I like some of the other farther out parks better simply because they are more scenic in terms of landscape (i.e., Lake Farm County Park).  For parking, there is a private lot here that I believe can get taken over by the Alliant Energy Center if there are large events (as overflow parking) so just be aware of that!

It also has an off-leash area as well.\n\nNote: The Yelp site map seems to be pinpointing the park on the wrong side of Hwy 151.  If you\'re coming from Madison you should exit Hwy 151 in Verona at Business 151 and take a quick right.  You then will turn into a drive that appears like you\'re going to the Badger Prairie Health Center but just go past that and you\'ll enter the park.\n\nWe first checked out the "mountain biking" trail head that departs from the first parking lot, next to the off-leash area.  This trail goes through a wee bit of prairie and then into woods briefly.  I wasn\'t wild about this trail because it borders a rather busy road so you hear a bit of traffic as you\'re walking which I find counter-intuitive to what I\'m looking for.  There is a second parking lot, about 1/2 a mile past the first, and this seems like a better point to start from.  The prairie is nicer here, longer grass, more wildflowers, less traffic nearby.  \n\nThe off-leash dog park is sizable and well-maintained.  It was moderately busy at 6pm on a Tuesday; you can see the trails and grassy areas in the posted photos.  \n\nAll in all, another great option.  I probably like the Lake Farm park a bit better if I had to choose between the two simply because it seems more "in the middle of nowhere".

We hiked along the Ice Age Trail (on-leash area for dogs) and were really pleased with the prairies, rolling hills, wooded areas, and Oak Savanna.  Another bonus is how the trail laces through the park, away from the road, so you don't hear all the traffic noise.  There is also a huge off-leash area which offers a similar sort of trail through many acres, long enough to tucker out the pooch as you wind through the park. It is definitely more of a park for hiking around versus standing around.

Mind you, I drive by this place dozens of times in a week going to the dentist, Sprouts or Goodwill. We got in the store and it was filled with local artists, talent, talk, wine, and, of course, ART.  \n\nWe had no intentions of making a purchase, we were just being nosy.

She was approachable, fun to chat with and not pushy. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked up to an art piece that stole my soul.  Seeing the fight I was having between my heart and purse, she made me "an offer I couldn\'t refuse."  So I said what most broke customers would say, "hold it for me and I\'ll come back." The enthusiasm that was on her face deflated immediately as I spoke those words.  I assured her that I would come back, I had to go rob \'Peter to pay Paul, plus talk to the hub.\'\n\nAn hour later, her face lit up as she saw me walk through the doors.  "I want my picture!" I declared. And the deal of my life was made.  I bought a $250, 60 lb, 48 x 56 frame art piece for $150 with free delivery! This is the most money I\'ve spent on a picture ever and it was worth it.  I figured since I work hard, I deserve something in my home that says so.\n\nFYI: They have art classes every second and fourth Tuesdays at the store and if you want to have a special group session, they will  accommodate your group on a different day.  Refreshment is provided but BYOB.  \n\nAlso, they have an art show once a month to meet local artists and perhaps make a purchase of a lifetime.\n\nThey got my business.

If you've seen one, you've seen this one. On the other hand, it's in a mall. That's right. An aquarium in a mall. I mean Concord Mills isn't your typical mall, so what did you expect? The attraction (they say that a lot) is run by a group that has a few of these - this is apparently the sixth in the US, and there are another couple of dozen scattered around Europe. So you may have seen them elsewhere, but this is the first in the area. The closest in the US is halfway across the country, so there's that.\n\nFirst, you buy your ticket. It's not cheap (though you can save a few bucks if you buy online, or if you buy an annual pass if you want to go a lot). Expect to spend a good percentage of $100 if you have a family of four - and well more than that if you hit up the souvenir shop on the way out.\n\nOn the way in, it's not unlike a Disney attraction - you get a little countdown timer, and cute animation and everything. Only the images aren't centered properly, so the porthole of your sub isn't exactly where it should be. Ignore that and pretend the room is moving, so you actually feel like you're in a submarine, so that when the doors open, you feel like you've moved, when in reality, you've gone nowhere. A bit more money in this department would do wonders. Even a visit to a Disney property would help explain why it's needed.\n\nRegardless, you then enter a cave-like aquarium, and the fish aren't bad. They say there are thousands of them, and there could be: But there aren't a huge variety. If you've been to the NC aquariums, you've seen otters and beluga whales and all sorts of wildlife. Not here. Just a bunch of fish. Even the touch tank only has a few starfish and some hermit crabs (admittedly, they are big hermit crabs). But you can see a bunch of those at Wings when you visit Myrtle Beach, it doesn't cost you anything, you can get your favorite team painted on the shell and if it dies you can usually get a free replacement.\n\nThere are a couple of nice displays - the horseshoe crabs are perhaps the most active I've seen anywhere, and they don't look dead (like they often do). The rays swim, rather than burying themselves. The blacklight display of jellyfish is cool to look at, but you can see things like that in Spencer Gifts (at least, I assume you can - perhaps I am dating myself). And the sea horses are always fun to watch. Perhaps the best display is near the end, where you can walk through a tunnel and see the head of Poseidon attached to some tentacles in some strange mythological mash-up. Most of the sharks were hanging out here, including the only hammerhead I saw the whole time.\n\nOne word of caution: The displays say not to use flash, which is fine because it usually reflects off the tanks. In fact, all of the plexiglass reflects horribly, so you get exit signs, display signs and the lady from Waukegan in your pictures. Try and take one looking up in the glass tunnel and you'll get nothing but LED lights and no detail on the fish because the lights are above you - in other words, pictures are almost a no-go here. But it is a reasonably interesting half-hour, especially if you have little ones.\n\nThat's right, I said half-hour. While it's a big place for the mall, it's not a big aquarium. You can stay about as long as you want, and you can cut through at the end to go back around again and again, but you probably won't stay very long overall. Keep that in mind, and understand what you're paying and you'll be fine.", 'stars': 3, 'user_id': '-_1ctLaz3jhPYc12hKXsEQ'}

I asked to have it removed she said she\'d have to get a supervisor. The supervisor "Trudy" came to the window and immediately noted that I would have to pay the late fee. She offered no solution, compromise and was extremely unprofessional. I was also surprised to see she was dressed for "happy hour" had globs and globs of mascara clumped to her nasty little lashes, gawdy jewelry, big giant hair, cleavage exposed and fake nails.

She only offered that I could provide a certificate from a doctor or hospital stating that I was incapacitated at time fees were due and then she could waive the $20.00 fee. Trudy left, I paid the $20.00 fee while complaining to the clerk. "You\'re barking up the wrong tree" is what this other government employee offered as comfort. Our tax dollars hard at work, folks. \n\nMore useless, overpaid government flunkys.

Visitez-là! Habitez-là! :) Wohaa! On y retrouve toutes sortes d\'espaces pour les travaillants et des aires de jeu pour les tous petits. En prime, c\'est une bible-boulathèque où l\'on peut faire du brruit!\xa0"\n\nLa bibliothèque n\'est ouverte que depuis quelque jours et je m\'y sens déjà chez moi. L\'architecture spectaculaire et généralement austère de Dan S. Hanganu s\'est cette fois-ci très bien adaptée à la personnalité de Sol, et offre un décor sophistiqué comportant toutes sortes de recoins à parcourir, des salles tantôt vastes tantôt intimes, et de l\'espace à ravir pour les enfants, qui semblent se vouloir être les vedettes de ces lieux. C\'est une bibliothèque où l\'on a le droit, semble-t-il, de "\xa0faire du bruit\xa0", à la différence des autres bibliothèques. \n\nÉtant une bibliothèque de quartier, elle dispose d\'une collection tout de même appréciable si on la compare aux autres bibliothèques du réseau. Elle comporte beaucoup d\'espaces de travail pour les adultes et quasiment tous les postes on des prises de courant pour les appareils. Il y a une connexion Internet du réseau gratuit "\xa0Île sans fil\xa0", qui fonctionne très bien même quand la bibliothèque est pleine.\n\nIl y a plusieurs salles de jeu, des salles de réunion, des salles multimédias, on peut louer des CD de musique, des films, des jeux vidéo, en plus de la collection habituelle de livre. Le réseau de prêt inter-bibliothèque de la ville de Montréal est également disponible aux usagers disposant d\'une carte de bibliothèque de la ville. Enfin, la bibliothèque est munie des équipements derniers cris pour le prêt, la recherche et le retour de documents. \n\nElle est située à deux pas de la station de métro Rosemont, et avec un peu de chance on peut se garer dans les rues avoisinantes.\n\nJe ne travaille pas pour le réseau des bibliothèques de Montréal, mais je lui donne mon appui à 100% pour ce lancement réussi. C\'est vrai que construire de telles installations peut s\'avérer onéreux, mais ce sont également ces projets qui, lorsqu\'ils sont bien menés, inspirent la prochaine génération d\'innovateurs, et dans ce cas-ci de lecteurs. Cette petite bibliothèque fera une très belle compagne à sa grande soeur la BAnQ, à la station Berri-UQAM (Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec).\n\nFinalement, l\'esprit de la poésie délurée du personnage de Sol, ce gentil mais pauvre sans-abris qui savais mieux que quiconque se défaire des contraintes de la langue afin de mieux défendre, avec sa verve particulière, des idéaux sociaux, me semble bien présent en ces murs. On y entend déjà des enfants jouer, les lignes zigzagantes de l\'architecture qui fuient au détour des couloirs et le murmure incessant des usagers travaillant ensemble ou échangeant quelques paroles sur des sujets de la littérature me semblent tous des signes que l\'héritage de Marc Favreau s\'est finalement trouvé une maison, un havre où il pourra continuer de s\'épanouir, au plus grand bénéfice des générations futures.', 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'ilaiK6eLYbzvIFZRg5TNDw'}

After my family lost my 18 year old cat we all had a hard time adjusting to the loss. After a mourning period, my sister had decided that to heal we should adopt another cat into the family. We had found this organization and really loved their mission and their websites made them seem outstanding (I even wanted to volunteer). \n\nI was very disappointed when I visited their facility. We had filled out an application online to adopt before coming in to visit their available pets. They were in the middle of changing facilities we were told at the time. There were many cat tunnels around for cats to play in, but they had a large amount of feces in them. A peek into the dog area showed a lot of feces as well. Previously working at an animal shelter, I know how important and also difficult it can be to keep these areas clean. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. I had found a cat that I believed from her biography online would get along with the other pets in my house (especially my other cat). The visit with her was very short and many of the employees and volunteers made no motions to come away from their computers to answer any questions or show us around the shelter. I had asked what the process would be to adopt the cat that we were interested in and was told that we would be contacted based on our application with denial for adoption or approval. \n\nWe waited several weeks for any calls from them. My sister decided to take initiative and call them instead thinking we were forgotten. Many times we were told we had to wait to speak to the woman who was head of adoptions and that she wasn\'t there at the time we called. We tried calling back several times in hopes to talk to this woman who seemed to never be there. Finally during one last attempt, we were told we were denied (probably because we have a dog door for our dog, which we could understand why that would be of concern to someone who does not know what responsible pet owners we are). Friends that I had recommended visit this place have told me that they referred to my family as "crazy" because we were diligently calling for a follow up from the adoptions coordinator. I do not give this organization one star for being denied. I feel they deserve this for their lack of professionalism and unsanitary living areas for pets.

Shame shame shame on me I never made it to their old ballpark in Fort Mill. But then it\'s Fort Mill (which in my world is like an universe away). Since I have never been to their previous games & location, I can\'t do a comparison of "before" vs. "now."\n\nI went with a group, sat in Section 120 (which is way down on 3rd base line a little away from the ball action). The face value of the ticket was $18, with $2 redeemable value for spending (very smart move on their part, because obviously nothing costs only $2, so it\'s a great way to induce people to spend).  I am not much of a baseball person, but it\'s always more fun to watch in person. It\'s hard to watch the game from where I was... and it\'s not like any other sports, they don\'t show the game on the jumbotron. And the sound system still needed a little work I suppose, I couldn\'t really hear much.\n\nI did take time to walk around the park, checked out their food and drinks offering. I\'m impressed that they offer some decent beer options (OMB Copper & NoDa special IPA brew, Sam Adams etc). However they don\'t come cheap. Small plastic cup was $7.50, tall boy was $9 and mason jar was $12. There were lots of food options as well. Queen City Q had a spot. There\'s a hotdog spot that offers Mac & Cheese dog and Chicago dog. They were $9 with chips. There was Chick-Fil-A. There was a fro-yo spot ($0.65/oz... but there\'s only 1 cash register, and it was broken, and the line was not moving... I had to abandon my melting fro-yo and opted for Dippin\' Dots-$6 with a souvenir helmet cup).  I\'m sure I\'m forgetting some. But I promise the food & drink options are great though a little expensive (but hey, we\'re at a game, so it\'s expected).\n\nI think this is a great addition to uptown. It does make parking even more of a nightmare. Parking lots were mostly $5-10 nearby. Or park further away on street (free on weekend) and walk, which is what I did.\n\nSide note: they have fireworks on Fridays.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'M-TwsqjrGVH9-qyw2KcvdQ'}

If you haven\'t got a smartphone with maps, good luck finding it. The turning is labelled "Scottish Widows printing" most conspicuously, and if you\'re heading in the dark (as most people will in darker parts of the year, before or after work) it\'s easy to miss any signage to the contrary.\n\nThe Delivery Office is where you go to pick up parcels that have been substituted for the Red Card of Failure and the team that works here is, in short, a joy. They are efficient, helpful and cheery, which given how much flak they must get from cross people who have this or that complaint about the non-delivery of their parcel, is little short of miraculous.\n\nThe room for parcel collection ("Customer Enquiries") is just a small room arranged to hold a queue of maybe about eight people leading up to the counter, which is usually staffed by two people. A chair is available in the corner in case your parcel is taking a while to arrive.\n\nNow then. The Red Card of Failure states that they will keep your parcel for 18 days before returning it to sender. It\'s worth being aware that this includes the day on which delivery was attempted, so when I arrived to collect my parcel today on what I thought was the 17th day, it was in fact the 18th. You\'d think that even day 18 of 18 would be acceptable and it would get sent back after the 18 days mentioned on the card were up, but it had already gone on the van to be returned. Frustrating indeed as it was a 40 minute jog for me to get there this evening! However, the chap was deeply apologetic and recognised that there had been a problem at their end, so I think my case of premature return might be an exception. Nonetheless, worth noting..!\n\nI also came here on 19 December, when the queue all evening was out the door. My heart sank when I joined the end of that queue but I couldn\'t believe how fast it moved. I sat there for a while on the chair, wrapping the item that had just been delivered (it was for that night) and observed the queue moving at a consistent pace and the staff never flagged once. Great to see.\n\nFinal note: at some delivery offices they don\'t bother asking for your ID before giving the parcel. They do here so make sure you take some along. And your best bet is to arrange redelivery online if you\'re nearing the end of the 18 day period, just in case!', 'stars': 3, 'user_id': '_lmmIZeJTv8roWn8qU3oIQ'}

The small store in Downtown Container park is stocked with gorgeous original artwork of pretty much any Disney character you can think of. They also have some really cute figurines and other collectables. If you are a Disney fan, this place really is a must stop. And if you have some money to burn, you might find yourself taking something home.\n\nIf you can physically take it home, that is. If you are visiting Las Vegas on vacation, as people are known to do from time to time, and want them to ship a purchase home to you well ... not so much. And here in lies the reason behind me giving out a VERY rare one-star review.\n\nAs I was exploring DTCP, I decided to stop in the Disney Fine Art store to look around. It was the day before Valentine\'s Day, and I thought I might find something here for my wife, who is a huge Disney fan. Most of the store is filled with really cool original paintings ... they\'re not cheap, but they have some fantastic pieces. I didn\'t see anything that I felt confident my wife would like, so I was hesitant to pull the trigger on an expensive piece of artwork. But I noticed these cute figurines in the back. They had one that was Kermit and Miss Piggy dining together ... my wife LOVES the Muppets, especially Kermit, so I thought this would be a perfect gift, and was entirely affordable and reasonable at $25. I asked the attendant working if they could ship it to me and she noted that it came in a box that would keep it safe. But I was doing carry-on only and was already tight on space, and I didn\'t want to risk it being broken, so I paid an extra $8 to have it delivered. I gave them my home address, paid with my credit card, and got a crappy handwritten receipt, plus an e-receipt via Square. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package, nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped, with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information, said he would look into it, and would call me back immediately with a status update. \n\nA couple of weeks pass again, and I\'ve heard nothing. I don\'t have time to track down things I\'ve already paid for and figure out why they haven\'t been shipped to me yet, so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I\'d give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening, and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there, etc. I didn\'t need to hear her story, but she sounded sincere, apologetic, and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally, I thought, I\'ll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file, apologized for it "slipping through the cracks" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\n\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING, you\'re today\'s big winner. I waited about 5 days, heard nothing, and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \n\nAgain, let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy. But if they can\'t ship a product I bought onsite, and paid to have shipped, within a month then they should think about making their one store function properly before opening others.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'hG7tKFN-REC22Zm48IP-0A'}

That being said, the overall premises was very new, clean and modern in appearance.  The southwest portion of the property has a grove of trees that has is an amazing place to do a photoshoot, particularly at sunset as it faces west with a mountain view as a backdrop with little obstruction other than the Gilbert road, the sidewalk and cars passing by.  The trees in the grove themselves and the brush/ leaves below are in and if themselves what make this a great location to shoot.  The staff that was here at the time we were shooting didn\'t seem to mind that we did our shoot in their grove and in fact, there were three other photoshoots going on at the same time we were shooting.  Although the grove itself is not particularly large, there seemed to be enough space for three separate shoots to go on at once.  The generosity of The Grove in letting the public use it space to create great artwork alone is testament to their attachment to the local community and speaks volumes as to their contribution to the City of Chandler.  Because of this experience alone. We will be certain to return the favor by at minimum doing business in their cafe and making an entire day of our next shoot here and thoroughly look forward to doing so.

The problem is the lights don\'t flash, ever - making the posted speed limit 45 on this otherwise 7-lane, high-speed highway that runs, unfenced, within feet of the school campus.  \n\nOne citation sent to a local resident driving a Chevrolet Suburban in February indicated her speed was "approximately 46 mph".   She was charged with "speed not reasonable and prudent".   The "ticket" was allegedly "signed" by someone named "Joseph Bonacci", whose badge ID #, coincidentally, end with "911", under the guise of "reasonable grounds to believe" a violation had been committed.\n\nFor those who can\'t see it, "photo radar" is a ticking time bomb left in the terminal at the Airport of Due Process. \n\nFirst, "approximately 46 mph" is not a legal standard of measure and, therefore, not evidence.  The operative word here - "approximately" - is vague and ambiguous.   "Approximately 46 mph" could be 47 mph or 45 mph or any other speed close to 46 mph which - absent the flashing lights - can not amount to conclusive proof of a violation of the de facto 45 mph limit.\n\nSecond, "speed not reasonable and prudent" is an opinion open to broad interpretation, and not an exact measure: what is reasonable and prudent under one set of conditions may not be reasonable and prudent under another. \n\nThird, the statement, "reasonable grounds to believe" clearly evades the mandatory language, "violation committed in my presence", the required wording under which all law enforcement personnel issue traffic citations.   If it didn\'t happen in an officer\'s presence it\'s hearsay, which is inadmissible.\n\nAnother complaint last December charged a retired doctor driving a light-colored Nissan with the same "speed not reasonable and prudent".   The same fake witnessing officer alleged the crime took place "on Southern between Franklin and Brimhall" in the city of Mesa.\n\nIn researching this story we went in search of these locations to verify, photograph and document them.  \n\nIn the instance by Skyline High School, we maintained a day-long vigil on a typical Tuesday, with classes in session, monitoring the lights from 7 AM to 4 PM and found none flashing.   A random check of neighbors, whose homes are within the proximity of the light poles, produced no one who ever recalls seeing the lights flash.\n\nIn the second instance, we drove the length of Southern Avenue in the city of Mesa, eastbound and westbound, and found no streets named Franklin or Brimhall.  We interviewed a local Code Enforcement officer familiar with the area, but she never heard of any streets named Franklin or Brimhall intersecting Southern Avenue.   Finally, in desperation, we even went to the Mesa Post Office and - SURPRISE! - they had no record of any such streets intersecting with Southern Avenue, either.\n\nAll speed control enforcement equipment is mandated by law to be regularly re-calibrated to ensure it is operating accurately.   In most instances this must be done after EACH use.   Because of the cost, few law enforcement agencies bother.   Any member of the public has the right to see the latest re-calibration documents for any given speed control enforcement device.   If the device has not been re-calibrated, its accuracy cannot be relied upon, and any violation must be dismissed for lack of evidence. \n\nEPILOG:\n\nAn increasingly corrupt government - from local politicians to coin-operated Congress and the military - is becoming America\'s most vocal complaint about over-reaching government abuse of citizens\' constitutional rights.\n\nMeanwhile, the credibility of Mesa\'s police department and city officials continues its southbound flush down the toilet of no return: their website claims to provide helpful links indicating red-light and speed enforcement locations and schedule.   However, these links have been disabled and no information is provided - amounting to one more false promise. \n\nIf you should receive a camera-generated traffic ticket, always assert your 6th Amendment Constitutional rights.\n   \nAnd if you think you\'ll just plead guilty, pay the fine and everyone will go home happy, think again: you\'ll have a chargeable traffic conviction on your record and your insurance premiums will quickly head north with all due dispatch.  \n\nAnd for fines ranging from $250 to $500 for each alleged offense, it is NOT worth it.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'UsU955fIDlLafLQqe24F-w'}

Nice place to take the pups and let them run free without worry of running off, or breaking the leash law in public.

I was told by a friend that Saving Paws had puppies so I filled out an application letting them know I was interested in a female.  I was contacted the next day by Laura and told there were only 3 males left.  So I made an appointment to meet the puppies for that day.  While there I met Trisha and Sandy; and I found a boy that I liked;  Another family came in to view a female, One of the ladies that works at the rescue shared with me she felt a Shepherd dog was not a good fit for this family.  So I let her know that if a female becomes available to let me know.  This was on a Friday.\n\nSunday I received a email from Sandy to give her a call.  She informed me that the female puppy is available for adoption, I was next in line for a female and to come by at 3pm.  My boyfriend and I made the long drive from Chandler to Glendale to meet the female puppy.  I fell in love with her instantly, I spent an hour with her and told Laura that I wanted her.  Laura wrote my name down on a piece of paper next to the female puppy\'s name and told me she was mine.  My boyfriend also fell in love with the 2 remained male puppies.  We told her we would like to take the female and one of the males.  She said there was another woman coming to view the remaining 2 male puppies the next day.  That whichever male was left we were welcome to take.  We were so excited to get to have a brother and sister.  There was another lady there named Michelle who does their website, she took a picture of me and the female puppy for their website and let me know to come back the following Sunday to get a picture of my new puppy with Santa.  I was so excited to get to take her home.  That evening I sent an email to Laura and Sandy thanking them for everything, they replied that they were excited for me to take the pups home.\n\nThen Monday night at 7:30 I got a call from Laura.  She said the the woman that came to view the pups wants the female I was already told was mine.  I was very confused on why this woman was even allowed to view the pup that was already promised to me.  Laura explained that their policy is based on the date a person fills out an application.  This was news to me because the 2 times I was at the rescue this was NEVER mentioned to me.  I even met Laura, Sandy and Trisha but still this was never mentioned to me.  All Laura could say to me was "I\'m sorry I wish this could be undone".  Still I was confused on what was done, why were they taking the puppy I was told was mine a day before away from me.  This policy was not posted on the application or their website and this was the first I was hearing back it.  Basically if I filled out an application first then came after all the puppies were promised to others I would be able to pick ANY of the pups?  That makes NO sense.  I told Laura I wanted Trisha to call me because she is the main person at the rescue.\n\nThe following day I heard nothing.  I called the numbers I had for Trisha and left a message.  I emailed Sandy and Trisha.  I received a email at 4:50am the next day.  Trisha stated that the puppies were not on a first come first get, it was based on the application date and this was explained to people when they were applying.  Which is a lie, at least in my case.  I have emails between the three ladies and I that never says anything like that.  I spoke to all of them in person and again this was never explained to me.  So because they messed up and made a mistake I am left to suffer.  I told Trisha that they should have made the appointments based on the applications then so that someone like me doesn\'t come in, fall in love, and then become heartbroken.\n\nI have always been pro-rescue when it comes to getting a fury family member.  But I would never recommend this rescue to someone.  I am very disappointment about how they are handling this.  They made the mistake and I feel they have done zero to fix it besides saying sorry.  I understand that there are lots of loving pups that need homes so I will find the right one for me.  I just wanted to warn people that might be dealing with this rescue.  I do not want this to happen to someone else.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'GfXlgk8uxMDt8JkSw-Vdxg'}

I will not deter you from donating or helping the kitties in anyway. The supplies are few and the cats suffer from this. For example, empty cat litter boxes with a few shreds of paper for litter. paper plates with dried up wet food and dry food scattered all over the floor. And the smell! This organization had moved locations and the SMELL still remains. Its called proper hygiene. Ive been to kennels and boarding facilities and other vets offices that don\'t have this smell. And its not cute kitten breath. \n\nGetting to the bigger picture, I want to talk about ethics and discrimination. A few months ago a rescued a sweetheart from the freeway. THE FREE WAY! How that baby got there I can only imagine. All I know is that I was going to save this kitty. I collect strays of all kinds. Not long ago my partner and I rescued Geoffrey. He had been lost and roaming Las Vegas for over a year. He was saved and actually returned to his owner. His story made news headlines...anyway, to the point.  I rescued this kitty and called my friend who works at BONANZA CAT HOSPITAL (look for my review on them) I call them because I have a friend that works there and they could help as this was what they do. She calls me back to tell me "there is no room at the inn" so to speak. She guides me to every other option in the book. Kitty Farms that are closed, or not answering phones cause they are full. I keep kitty overnight in a friends garage. I would have kept the kitty myself, but I have a special needs kitty with a sensitive heart condition and I couldn\'t sacrifice one for the other. Luckily I made this rescue kitty comfortable, watered and fed overnight with friends.  I try to take kitty to the no kill shelter here on Dewey..FULL as well. Since I can not foster for 2 months like they needed me to do, I take kitty back to the car and start making more phone calls for placement (friends, family, more shelters)\n\nMy friend who worked at the Bonanza Cat Hospital which is in direct conjunction with the POPPY FOUNDATION, says bring the cat to us.  I am so thankful and I drive us all back across town to the exact location I called the night before. Suddenly, there is "room at the inn"\n\nJust yesterday, after trying to attain my kitties file to move onto a new vet, DR. LINDA STEELMAN reminds me of the time a few months ago of when I was looking for somewhere to bring the kitty, she has the audacity to mention that "she knew that it was Me who was asking for help, and that is why she wouldn\'t take the rescue." "Only because my friend who works there asked, did she decide to take the kitty!" \n\nThis is where the discrimination and violation of Veterinary Ethics comes in. Her statement alone violates her sworn duty to protect and care for these animals. She has every right to be a bigot and refuse my business. But she has NO RIGHT and it is a travesty to turn away a lost kitty like that, based on her hatred for my orientation. \n\nI am still in shock that she has the gumption in this day and age to treat people this way. I thought this foundation was based around helping the kitties. \n\nBoth Lina Steelman and Linda Newman are counterparts in this facility and this foundation. They will try and tell you that "they only rent the facility" or that they have nothing truly to do with one another. But that is absolutely untrue. They make decisions together, and they discriminate together as well. LINDA NEWMAN is the Office Manager at Bonanza, and President of the POPPY FOUNDATION. So you\'re not separate, you\'re definitely equal.  \n\nTo be clear, I have known about and supported this group since 1999. I have sent business to them, I have sent rescues to them and I have supported their efforts. \n\nI also raise money for and support\n\nHeaven Cant Wait\nCircus Couture (raising money for pediatric cancer research, local non profit)\nSuper Summer Theatre\nOpportunity Village\nThe Center\n\n...these are just the local organizations I support and donate my time and efforts to. So I am by no means a terrible person, or a person who tries to bring down a good thing. I just wanted the truth of these two bullies, and the moderators of their Facebook page, who cyber bullied me for making this review, to come to light. \n\nSincerely,\n\na devoted pet owner for life and a proud parent of a Special Needs Kitty of 17years.', 'stars': 1, 'user_id': 'ngo3OxZ2CYojTkDillJHAw'}

There are numerous car rental agencies located here with a multitude of websites to rent through, but the main reason for this particular review is related to finding it, especially upon return!  This review does NOT reflect my feelings about the car rental service that I actually used to rent the car.\n\nThe center itself appears quite new.  There is a huge garage housing the rental cars and a level of the building dedicated to providing service to customers.  The center is about 8-10 minutes FREE SHUTTLE from the airport and each airport terminal provides a shuttle to the single center.  Upon returning your car and heading back to the airport, just be sure you\'ve identified the correct terminal that you need the shuttle to take you.  From return to arrival at the airport, give yourself 30 minutes of fluff in case the shuttle is not there right away.\n\nThe signage to get into the car rental center really sucks.  At night there is a serious lack of lighted signs with text large enough to read.  Be aware that the address of this center is at 1805 East Sky Harbor Circle South and you\'re looking for signs for "car rental return."\n\nIf you\'re returning from south of Phoenix, you\'re on the I-10 heading West.  You want to take Exit 150B to South 24th Street.  Take a Right at the end of the ramp onto S 24th.  At the first light there is NO SIGN HERE!! but you need to take a Left onto Sky Harbor Cir S.  Keep your eyes open!  Your next turn is to the left.  Here there is a TINY SIGN that says "Car Rental Return" and there is no lighting for this sign!\n\nThe facilities are clean and the shuttles are frequent enough.  Good luck!!', 'stars': 2, 'user_id': 'S55BzJZBcd9e3u-2PKQdsw'}

There was plenty of parking on site and the facilities are shiny and new, which is an added bonus. As far as the service goes, if you haven\'t been to elevation before all I can say is you have to be ready for the Elevation Experience. \n\nUpon entering their property you WILL be greeted with a smile and feel welcomed. Volunteers line up at the entrance to form a hall of people that you go down. Everyone will smile and many will say "welcome". If you don\'t feel welcomed at Elevation, it is certainly not due to a WHOLE Hearted effort on behalf of the team. Think of the line that\'s formed by a basketball team when the starting lineup is being call, where you slap hands with folks on both sides. If the spirit moves you, run down and high five everyone. I\'m sure no on will mind. It\'s good that they want you to feel excited going into church. That is only the beginning of the elevation experience.\n\nNext up, going into the sanctuary. Not sure if they call it that, but you get the point. You will be ushered to a seat. When I was there, we did not get to choose our seat. The positive thing about this is that with every seat filled, there isn\'t all of that scooting down and crossing over folks with latecomers. The negative is that you have to step out of your comfort zone and make a request if you want to sit elsewhere in the event you know you have to leave early for whatever reason.\n\nService starts with praise and worship. Listen to me because this is very important. The music is LOUD. I repeat: THE MUSIC IS LOUD. The decibel level rivals that of a rock concert and that\'s because what you are experiencing is a Christian Rock concert Every single Sunday. The band gives their all. You can always ask for earplugs. I have to when I visit because it\'s too much for my ears. The ushers have them handy.\n\nThen there\'s my favorite part of the service, the sermon. Pastor Steven is a great orator and man of God. His messages are usually 30 minutes. He is not live at this location, so you\'ll be watching the sermon on a screen. That\'s a visit to elevation in a nutshell. I\'m leaving out some details such as the VIP experience because I\'m tired of writing.

First off, let me back track and say this is AMAZING that Pittsburgh has a bike rental service. We now have wide open bike lanes, a bike friendly community and people ready to hop on there and ride. Me being on of them. But hop on and ride I did not...\n\nI had friends in from out of town and thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this out for the first time. Probably in hindsight I should have done my research, but how hard could bike rental be? Very hard it turns out. I tried earlier to bring up their website and figure out how to tackle the steps needed before going. I was very confused with their website in terms of how to sign up. Plus, I thought it was weird there was no prompted for an app. When I googled an app, I couldn't find one either, so I figured there was none. I finally signed up for what was the first step. I tried to enter my credit card for the second step and it kept denying it. \n\nWe went to the kiosk on 10th and Penn and there was a kiosk, so I thought good, I can just do the transaction there. After typing in my phone number a couple times and then the pin I got in the email, the VERY sensitive key bad literally blacked out. Broken. Well... we finally got someone's card to work on their website and got the bikes out... after a half an hour of sorting out the rental process. \n\nWe gloriously rode down the Penn Ave bike lane. Wind in our hair, bell ringing and waving to happy people passing us by. It was awesome. We went to the Strip and locked our bikes up outside of Bella Notte and sat down for a bite. After some delicious pizza we were ready to roll again. After typing in 3 of the 4 pins we needed for our bikes, the last bike wouldn't unlock. Well, that's odd. We tried everything... they give you two pins, which is confusing in itself. We'd type in the two pins and then the screen would black out. \n\nSo we called costumer service and proceeded to be put on hold for over a half hour. We finally go through to India, because that's were the call center apparently is. We find out that there's a city wide issue and all the bikes are broken. Great. So we somehow convinced the dude to refund us for that bike. We literally had to leave the bike there, sadly. \n\nSo we biked down a couple blocks to the 21st and Smallman station and locked the 3 bikes up. We ended up seeing another sad looking couple who was also sitting on hold for the same problem. What a crappy situation. Thankfully, we were refunded for all 4 bikes, which was awesome, but still it kinda ruined our plans for the day. \n\nAgain, I'm SO excited that we have something like this in Pittsburgh, although I wish they would have gone with an American company instead of what I believe is a German manufacturer. And how about having an American call center as well... or better yet, a local one? How about one step further and have people out on the streets covering some ground when there's issues. \n\nSome might say I'm crazy, but I'll give it another try. But I'll be wary. \n\nIMPORTANT INFO: they do have an app called NextBike, so download it and  Yeah I know, no name matches up, but I think it's the company that runs them. My advice is to add all your information and have your credit card stored so you can hopefully have an easier time than I did!\n\nMy hope is that I can come back in a couple months and write a five star review.", 'stars': 2, 'user_id': 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ'}

Unlike his own multi-building home cum college campus, this is a domestically sized structure, still featuring a tight period kitchen and numerous typically FLW built in components. Although today the unobstructed views of distant hills over a surrounding orange orchard shown in period photographs have been built up, the house itself still sits on a large lot which is in the process of landscape restoration and free tours are available by appointment.\nThere are dozens of FLW private homes and public buildings open for viewing across the U.S (including the original Taliesin in Spring Green, WI as well as nearby Taliesin West in Scottsdale, AZ), but the David and Gladys Wright House features a very different sensibility and is definitely worth a trip for lovers of contemporary architecture and design. Occupied by Gladys Wright until her death in 2008, the house narrowly escaped destruction by developers anxious to turn the two acre site into something "new," and missing the modernity and uniqueness of the structure. The house is built in a spiral which for those who know it instantly brings to mind FLW\'s later Guggenheim Museum (NY) whose construction he was overseeing at his death as well as his unrealized Automobile Objective of decades earlier. \nBecause of the objections of some owners of neighboring mansions (whose placards stating "Wright House, Wrong Place" opposing the opening of the house to the public could still be seen on some local lawns in summer 2015) there are limited amenities here and even with a reservation you must park at a neighboring church and enter almost surreptitiously through an otherwise imperceptible door in a stockade fence surrounding the property. However, there is increasing local recognition of the value of the home to the entire community as well as the world at large so thanks to those who formed a foundation to save the house it is anticipated that it will become increasingly accessible. Only very limited numbers can be accommodated and indeed I was the only person to show for the tour I booked last month; the guide was pleasant, if not necessarily an expert.', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': 'mzfhaHleY8ppyTo91rvgtg'}

Apparently, it's been put on by a local couple for 30 years and it's turned into a bit of a side business for them. The entire thing is free, but they do sell some food, toys and such to help offset the cost of the electric bill, I surmise. While I was there, Santa shared with me the Naughty and Nice things to do while visiting the lights:\n\nNaughty\n\n*Don't stop in the middle of the road and block-up traffic just so you can jump out and take a selfie.\n\n*Don't block their neighbors' driveways because you are too lazy to walk an extra 10'--are you on a calorie saving program???\n\n*Don't start touching and messing with the lights and displays. \n\nNice:\n\n*Do make a donation to help out\n\n*Do park respectfully and try not to bother their neighbors.\n\n*Do buy some snacks (i.e., Rice Krispie treats, Cookies, Hot Chocolate) to eat while enjoying the lights. \n\nSanta said that by adhering to the above rules you won't get a lump of Reindeer Doody in your Stocking. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good Yelp!", 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'iChZhRINmSKYoHhesh7grA'}

Clothes are elegant, unique, fashion forward, but a little pricey, most of it impossible to find anywhere,  absolutely worth it though.  Jewelry is fantastic.  They throw a mean party for their gallery openings and one of the best Halloween parties Ive ever been to.  Definitely worth a trip!', 'stars': 4, 'user_id': '5KLbZI44jvHlkEgI4yaqXQ'}
