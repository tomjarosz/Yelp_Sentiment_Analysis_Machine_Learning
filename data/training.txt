For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. \n\nMy first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.", 'business_id': 'RxKrw38oyeYszQ6guY5b1A', 'votes': {'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0}, 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'K1oHkXNn1ZRmdnSN5AFsGw'}

I had always heard kill/no-kill shelters whatever... I got my new dog Crosby from ARL which happens to be a "kill shelter". Thinking about this, I felt truly good getting him there because I felt as though I was saving him from some other destiny. However, he is so cute that I\'m sure someone else would have adopted him...\n\nThe shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly. The dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff. Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt. Another perk is that when Crosby had "kennel cough" we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated him...In short, great adoption experience at ARL.', 'business_id': 'VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg', 'votes': {'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0}, 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'RobeXeaUf_E9x8Jp5tnEiw'}

Ararat is that it's not a black church or a white church, but it's a church for all people of all colors and races. Pastor Curtis is one of the best teachers and preaches I have ever heard! \n\nMen's bible study is on the first Monday of the month at 7pm. Regular bible study is on Tuesdays at 12 noon and 6pm. Saturday night live worship service is at 7pm. Sunday morning worship times are 7am, 9:30 and 11:45am. If you can't make it to Tuesday evening bible study or worship service on Sunday you can watch them on the churches website. \n\nThere are even shuttles to pick you up in Oakland if you are a college student and would like to go Sunday worship service. \n\nNot to mention the Rement Choir is amazing. They came in second place in the 2009 National How Sweet The Sound Choir Competition! They have put out two Cd's. The second one, Only Jesus was recently released and it is amazing! \n\nThey even have a separate youth worship service during the 11:45 service for children from six all the way to teenager's. \n\nIf you go to the 11:45 service on Sunday you'll see me in the balcony during the spring and summer and at the 9:30 service during football season.\n\nhttp://www.mt-ararat.org/", 'business_id': 'fp-tknN_5XBmhUS4fSJBgQ', 'votes': {'useful': 8, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 5}, 'stars': 5, 'user_id': 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw'}
