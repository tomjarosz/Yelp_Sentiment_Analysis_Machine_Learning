292235,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0.025,but if you are like me and have traveled near and far to other locations will find that this library is lacking,
292236,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0,here are just my thoughts:,
292237,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0,1) this library is lacking in signs,
292238,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0.11875,for example aside from the cute little cut up's posted on the side of the children's reference desk there is no other indications to distinguish the children's and adult's reference desk,

292242,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0.2375,2) where is the youth/teen only section like the one at enterprise? i'm not a teen but i think having your own area to chill is cool,
292243,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0.05,3) the study rooms make me feel like i'm a showcase at the circus with the clear big windows,

292247,97h-_XnVGKl4fuVOZrlWPw,LLA7QhgUOLGLiTRMAe7aSQ,TNsPb6JYtmJNtiANI-SiZg,2,0.8,"then again it's probably just me, lol",

301367,6Nt8WaUQW_-laYxUVp8dMA,eV4_2Dzrzpu1SmECLScPoQ,WupkPPKDYx2mQck-tPFvdQ,5,0.2,this absolutely prevents wasting time just to memorize where the track goes when driving a real car,
