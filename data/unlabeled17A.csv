74470,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0,the  radiologist was ultimately determined to be a dumbass,
74471,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0,"but because of his incorrect reading of the 4 ct scans, i was just about to get out of there and drive the several hours home",

74475,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0.075,"so the admitting physician/hospitalist put me on a no food or drink order as he expected me to have a surgical procedure, done first thing in the morning, to try to correct the misdiagnosed ct scans",

74478,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0,so around 2pm the surgeon/specialist rounds and sees me,

74481,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0,"so i waited 20 hours without even water and the hospitalist knew it, and made me wait even longer",

74483,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0.91,now the surgeon/specialist was very good,

74485,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0.1,"so it was clear that i had all the meds i needed and could go home that day, but we had to get the orders from the hospitalist",

74487,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,0.5,so she needed to make sure they would release me,

74490,0AQR6_0SUQRlt-uNzazquw,6vYamTrBku9xURhqxKyw0g,v1WRddKCgawrvDEYu_oyjg,1,1,so my nurse linda (probably one of the best nurses i ever had) tells me to tell my sister to get on the plane becuase she will make my discharge happen,

76632,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0.55,"let's be clear, i like what the az humane society does and i think their campus for compassion is a mind boggling awesome facility",
76633,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0,my only problem is that out of the three times we've gone to visit they were,
76634,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0,out of dogs,
76635,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0.2,it's entirely possible we have poor timing or that their adoption program is so fantastic that the dogs fly out of their kennels but,
76636,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,-0.05,it was still rather strange and i couldn't help but wonder if their kennels are being under utilized,
76637,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0.4,"but that's all just idle speculation and perhaps a plea for them to get more good dogs out of the county shelters and into the air conditioned, classical music playing comfort of their campus for compassion",
76638,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0,i have no doubt that once a dog gets into one of these places he is well cared for,
76639,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0.3,one thing i particularly liked about their design was that there was a low wall separating the two rows of kennels in each building,
76640,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0.4,i think that seems like a fantastic idea for lowering the animals stress as they don't have to stare across the hallway at some pissed off dachshund all day,
76641,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0,it also means that getting dogs too and from their kennels isn't as big as a deal because there is only one row of barking dogs they have to worry about,
76642,hGx6lT0RypJcgOJjzoLAQQ,mQde7KRomOQoUyPGTqeXhA,QpojpZCkxbVWxUcwMWcmCg,4,0,"and yes, it's probably the nicest shelter i've ever heard about",
