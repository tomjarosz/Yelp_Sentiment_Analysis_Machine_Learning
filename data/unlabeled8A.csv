229558,hPaKIfHI5uddocXxopF-4g,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,0,we went up to the second floor and where given a tour of the labor room,
229559,hPaKIfHI5uddocXxopF-4g,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,-0.125,the labor room was quite big and they even offered a small chair that turns in to a bed for dad to spend the night in,
229560,hPaKIfHI5uddocXxopF-4g,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,0,we were informed at this time that the baby will not be leaving the room during our stay there unless there is a complication,
229561,hPaKIfHI5uddocXxopF-4g,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,0.375,this really excited my wife and i,

229563,#NAME?,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,1s7b1Q5ORBrKD5vFvThAJA,1,0,i delivered my child at san martin and will never set foot in that hospital again,
229564,#NAME?,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,1s7b1Q5ORBrKD5vFvThAJA,1,0.25,the nurses know nothing about supporting a laboring mother,
229565,#NAME?,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,1s7b1Q5ORBrKD5vFvThAJA,1,-0.077777778,portia and rose in particular were horrible,

229567,#NAME?,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,1s7b1Q5ORBrKD5vFvThAJA,1,0,i have never felt as mistreated in my life as i did at this hospital,
229568,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,my last review was written on a day that i went to st,
229569,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.6,rose,
229570,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,however that specific day was not the day i did the tour that day i was actually at st,
229571,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.2375,rose because our obgyn advised to go to the hospital due to dehydration,
229572,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,-0.91,at this visit i had very bad experience which caused me to look for patients advocate,
229573,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,-0.25,i went to the information desk and had a difficult time getting to understand who i was looking to speak with finally one of the volunteers called the house supervisor,
229574,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,-0.027777778,"the house supervisor came down and fixed the ""incident"" i had",
229575,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,i did not want to write my review based solely on that experience so i held of on writing this review,
229576,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,on 5/14/2013 my wife and i came to the hospital as she was scheduled to be induced,
229577,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.233333333,we were quickly greeted on the second floor and promptly escorted to a clean and sterile room,
229578,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,as we setup our nurse for the day came in her name was darlene and the cna's name was douglas,
229579,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.125,now at first i was a bit on the fence about having a male cna,
229580,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.315,lets be honest as a man i don't want any other man touching my wife unless he's some type of doctor and someone that i'm completely comfortable with to just throw someone i've never met in the loop and say hey this dude is going to be sticking his fingers in your wife just watch makes me very uneasy,
229581,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.333333333,i decided to see how things went and if i didn't feel comfortable i would be saying something but let me say that douglas has to be the most professional and well mannered cna that i've met,
229582,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.1,he always remained professional and his attitude never changed through out the day,
229583,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.44609375,darlene was also great she went above and beyond to make sure my wife and myself where beyond comfortable she defiantly deserved and applause with her and douglas i think i'd call them the dynamic duo :)!!!,
229584,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,the one thing that did occur in the middle of our stay was that engineering came to the room and swapped out the whiteboards,
229585,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.183838384,they put up new and better looking whiteboards however he didn't clean up after himself he left the old whiteboards on the floor of the room and they stayed there through our entire stay i guess no one cared that 1 it was an eye sore and 2 it was in the way,
229586,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.033333333,i found it interesting how engineering has time to swap whiteboards but there's no time to fix the broken number 2 in the second elevator,
229587,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.25,i also asked 3 times for engineering to come to the room to check the hot water and a leak in the shower head well i think i'm going to check out and i don't think these issues will get addressed,
229588,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,-0.087878788,the induction lasted longer then when expected so it ran late at 7 we had a shift change and a new nurse her name was angella,
229589,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,-0.058333333,as soon as douglas introduced us i felt a little put off as she seemed a little perturbed and very phlegmatic,
229590,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,i tried not to be put off by this and i figured like douglas i would give this nurse a try,
229591,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.8,when labor started to occurred the doctor and everyone was great,
229592,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,i however did catch myself looking over at the nurse several times and instead of being focused on the labor i caught her watching tv several times i figured i just looked at her when she wasn't truly looking,
229593,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.033333333,"i then wanted to step outside for a moment since the baby was out i asked angella if i would get a bracelet to identify me as the dad she said yes but they would not be printed till tomorrow morning i thought this was odd but i didn't make a point about it, we then wanted to try and breast feed the baby at this hospital there is a lot of breast feeding information so i thought we would get great assistance wrong we asked angella for assistance and she seemed so frustrated by us that she told us that if we really wanted to feed him and she couldn't breast feed on her own we could give him a bottle",
229594,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.125,i then asked about engineering possibly coming to check our bathroom because there was a leak in the shower and the water was not so hot,
229595,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0,her answer well shes not going to taker a shower now so they will not come and they might come in the morning i guess i'm chopped liver and don't need to take a shower,
229596,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.7,at this point i was fed up and asked to speak with the charge nurse and i expressed my frustrations thankfully rose the head nurse was happy to take over for the rest of the night,
229597,JFCQ7g-Fgxnlrr5RCMuFew,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,3,0.4,i will finish my review at check out hope the rest runs smoothly from here on out,

229599,WfwxKDtHGoffu_YJWwZ8mg,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,0.7,i'd want to say good but i don't feel that all my issues where addressed in a timely manner,

229602,WfwxKDtHGoffu_YJWwZ8mg,5FTEU6KCvMeZyuqkbLAWtw,GmKRNgo_0DtccDHznvWVHQ,4,0,in my experience i happened to encounter one of those,
