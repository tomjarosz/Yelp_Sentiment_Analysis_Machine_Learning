221679,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0,let me start by saying unless your a texas ranger or kansas city royal fan,

221688,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0.25,i have 3 more to cover next season that i didn't get to this year,

221692,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0,the reason i say that is because there is a library,

221697,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0.285714286,however be warned when you make the right onto bullard off of bell road,
221698,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0,you have to go to the end of the strip and turn around to come back for the parking because it is all on the opposite side of the street,
221699,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,-0.1625,there is a heavy police presence like i have not seen at other parks as well,

221701,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0,but they block it off,

221703,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0,remember what i said though,
221704,T1ryzAgcCqN3rJh5Xjqatw,L3BSpFvxcNf3T_teitgt6A,ky9pQ8AKufvZ63IxR41jGg,4,0.4,free parking,
